1) Hes an entertainer, marketer and a businessman. That's what he does and that's how he supposedly makes his millions and billions of dollars per year that he reports.
2) He was a democrat pre-recession. Now he's a republican. And if he's forced out by the RNC officials, he'll be ""running as independent."" Some loyalty to your new family.
3) To be the president, you need to be able to walk the walk and talk the talk. You need to balance your media image, public and political image. You need to be able to look in the camera and not embarrass yourself. You need to not insult our border neighbors and not insult our POWs.
3) Then again, controversy often sells.. 
4) He's an outstanding businessman and marketer, hands down. But our enemies overseas aren't interested in doing business with us. We are enduring serious events as a country, so I like to think we should have an equally serious leader,=.
5) Mexican remarks -- somewhere along the line if he does eventually become president, he would undoubtedly say the WRONG thing to the WRONG country, potentially damaging years of diplomatic relationships. 
6) The GOP has a pool of over a dozen potential candidates, none of whom can..""self-fund"" or even raise funds the way Trump can. So, what better way to keep the potential democratic nominee out of earshot of the media,while simultaneously saving money and performing his political sidewalk theatre, than to have pottymouth Trump barking half-truths to a confused, yet concerned republican party?
7) According to Politifact, his statements are littered with false and misinformation. http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/

Don't get me wrong, I'll admit Trump has grown on me significantly. He just keeps talking and insulting and reiterating: it's a lot of fun to see someone shoot themselves in the foot over and over, only to walk away as if nothing happened.

It's not like he's a totally different person, but just more 'normal'.

148,Brynden_Rivers_Esq,"Thank you very much for this! It was definitely a good watch to show that he's not a nutjob and that he has actual policies in mind. I agree, he really needs to make clear what his beliefs are, most candidates talk about these things on their webpage, but Trump doesn't. At the moment it seems like he's just gliding along on a cult of personality (and some undercurrents of xenophobia. You'll forgive my saying so, but even a fan would have to admit that they see why xenophobic people would be drawn to what he's portrayed as in the media).

I really agree with his sentiment that everyone lives under our safety blanket and we should find a way to make that arrangement more fair, but I don't know exactly what he means to do about it, and I'd worry when he says stuff like ""take the oil"" that he'd make a lot of problems for Americans and others worse with that approach.

I like his position on NAFTA and the TPP.

I had no idea he ever had a position on the environment.

I don't think the discussion of being a ""debtor nation"" is very compelling; I mean as long as we're not at risk of defaulting (for economic reasons, forget politics for a while, because that's just ridiculous) there's no reason that debt for a nation is bad; it's not like an individual.

It was good to hear him talk about healthcare; I'm a believer in single-payer, and I know he used to be. It sounds like he's not now, but at least he wants people covered. I guess I feel like under the next president or maybe the one after that there's a good chance that we're going to be facing something like 30% unemployment or underemployment because of automation. When medicare has a 3% overhead and insurance companies have 20-40% overhead, I don't really see how people think private insurance makes sense and that it wont collapse onto an un-prepared medicare system. If we instead just got medicare ready for that we could really *save* money in the future.

I'm also not sure I agree about being ""rough"" on crime, or with his characterization of cops as ""some percentage bad, some percentage good"" which characterizing illegal immigrants in more harsher terms and with a broader brush. I hope when he talks about a wall he's kidding. Talk about a waste of money.
",1439307791,ctz8gw9
149,Dreturn,"About healthcare, I can't provide a link to the exact interview, but I get the impression he is for expanding medicare for many people and would be opposed to privatizing social security in any way.

I agree that debt isn't inherently bad, but I wonder when a group owns a lot of the debt, like China, ( [China and Japan own about 7% each](http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2014/10/28/who-owns-the-most-u-s-debt/) ) if that doesn't give them undue influence in some way.

About 'taking the oil', that is a bizarre way of him phrasing it, but maybe you are old enough to remember when George W. Bush told everyone on the eve of the Iraq war that the Iraqi oil would pay for it. Of course, that wasn't the case. It was a horrible money sink, not to mention the horrible cost in lives and limbs, not only of our soldiers but of the people unlucky enough to be living inside a country run by a dictator Bush decided to kill.

That war cost [about a trillion (1,000,000,000,000) dollars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_cost_of_the_Iraq_War#U.S._war_costs), despite, as that points out, the politicians promising the cost would be in the billions. I think when Trump talks about taking the oil or national resources, it's being more honest than saying we're exporting democracy or something. I'm very anti-war, but I'm also anti-paying for war. If war is necessary, then I see no problem with taking resources from the country to help pay for some of the costs. We should also rebuild infrastructure and build schools and great roads and all of that. At the same time, I think of the massive amounts of money the U.S. put into rebuilding Europe after WWII with very little direct benefit, but it can't be argued that the benefit for mankind was worth that expenditure.

I think building an actual wall is absurd, but a lot can be accomplished monitoring the border with a virtual wall, drones that can stay up for hours, maybe days, allowing for real time monitoring, would cost a fraction of what a physical wall would. ",1439309299,ctz9gms
150,Brynden_Rivers_Esq,"Yeah it came across in that interview that he's not opposed to a substantial safety net if the alternative is people suffering.

I think the thing with china owning a lot of our debt is that, as J Paul Getty said ""If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem.""

We just have to keep paying it back, and then they're in our pocket, because we have the leverage of defaulting (which neither of us want, but at least we'd have the cash and they'd have a shortfall if it ever came to that).

173,BoiseNTheHood,"&gt; His tax cuts fueled the 80s boom.

His ""tax cuts"" were more myth than reality.  His 1981 tax cuts did little for anybody, because Social Security tax hikes and bracket creep canceled out most of their effects.  He raised taxes on gasoline and the trucking industry.  He signed off on what was the largest peacetime tax hike in history (TEFRA), which raised taxes by almost 1% of the GDP.  A lot of his tax increases were hidden behind phrases like ""increased fees,"" ""IRS enforcement"" and ""revenue enhancements"" because he knew that coming out and saying it would be unpopular among the base.  Reagan also tripled the state income tax during his time as governor of California.

&gt; His idea was to ""starve the beast"" but he dealt with a Democratic House for 8 years.

Except he never wanted to ""starve the beast"" in practice.  [His proposed budgets never significantly differed from the ones that got passed.](http://zfacts.com/p/57.html)  Both of the budgets that got passed under the Democrat-controlled Congress in his final two years were actually slightly lower than his proposal, which is sad, because Democrats are the ones who are supposed to be the big spenders.

Reagan was undeniably a great speaker, and that's where most of his appeal came from.  But he was all talk and his actions rarely backed it up in office.

Either these things are real or not. Of course Mexico has no benefit from stopping; money **illegally** sent home, people **illegally** crossing the border, and people **illegally** staying in our country.

326,BoiseNTheHood,"&gt; The proper course for the right-wing opposition must necessarily be a strategy of boldness and confrontation, of dynamism and excitement, a strategy, in short, of rousing the masses from their slumber and exposing the arrogant elites that are ruling them, controlling them, taxing them, and ripping them off.

&gt; And so the proper strategy for the right wing must be what we can call ""right-wing populism"": exciting, dynamic, tough, and confrontational, rousing and inspiring not only the exploited masses, but the often-shell-shocked right-wing intellectual cadre as well. And in this era where the intellectual and media elites are all establishment liberal-conservatives, all in a deep sense one variety or another of social democrat, all bitterly hostile to a genuine Right, we need a dynamic, charismatic leader who has the ability to short-circuit the media elites, and to reach and rouse the masses directly. We need a leadership that can reach the masses and cut through the crippling and distorting hermeneutical fog spread by the media elites.",1440531008,cufeqwi

405,DeanBlandino,"In post-war Germany, a popular issue in contemporary philosophy was the issue of the Nazis being popular, yet irrational and obviously damaging to the country. Why would a country support a candidate who made little logical sense? Why would a country support a leader who, if followed, would obviously destroy a nation? One of the better essays I have read described it in a very convincing fashion. He describe the obvious stupidity and irrationality of the leader being a mechanism of belief. People were more comfortable voting for a bad idea from which they felt distance, than a good idea that changed society. By feeling a part of a group, it was easier to make a bad decision that only hurt others. The reasoning goes, capitalism leads to fascism, and frankly I agree.

Fascism manifests itself in different ways each time it happens, but Donald Trump is a terrifying fascist. His claims are as scary as they they are laughable. His views are obviously damaging to America if they were seen through, but they would never be seen through. That's the whole point of being a conservative. You represent the elite. You don't have to fix America, you just have to talk shit, win elections, and keep the same people in power. Nothing they say ever happens, from balancing the check book to creating a jobs. All they do is maintain power. What's scary about Trump is the same thing that's scary about aligning oneself with tea party. When you rile up certain groups of people, sometimes you lose control of the boat you think you're steering. If Trump actually kicked out all the illegal immigrants in this country, our economy would collapse. It's a stupid premise, but one with real consequence.

That is something that would be incredibly low tech, just a bunch of people with binoculars. Have a smaller base every 50 miles that they work from for months at a time at the more remote locations, the ones closer to cities would have more permanent staff. Assuming that base is responsible for 25 miles in either direction, they could have a response time of under half an hour by road vehicle to even the most remote towers, and a response time of minutes by helicopter or drone that could track the criminals.

A wall is feasible.

You make them pay by imposing tariffs on their goods. Let's say it just costs 1 million dollars a mile for the wall. 2,000 miles would be 2 billion dollars.

Mexico's GDP for 2014 was 1282.72 billion, or 1.28 trillion dollars. 2 billion/1282 billion, means a 2 billion dollar wall would be 1/641st of the GDP, or 0.00156% of their GDP. Ok, maybe a million dollars a mile is low, maybe it's 10 million a mile, so bump it up to 1/64th of their GDP for a single year.

india has one that you can see from space, although its more of a glorified fence, its still a reasonably effective barrier, because to overcome it takes time, and when you patrol that fence properly, you dont have that much time 

the most important part is monitoring and patrolling it

you can use drones for surveillance, and have patrols that are able to respond to incursions

putting up a barrier means its harder to cross, it takes more time, and is more risky

patrolling and enforcing that border combined with surveillance and a barrier to slow them down means you catch far, far more

it becomes a mental barrier to people wanting to cross illegally. When everyone says its easy, you can just walk across, a lot more try it than when its hard, you cant just carry your kids across, the risk of getting caught is high

a wall is feasible, the cost isnt prohibitive at all, india can build one that works , so can we",1441040223,culzn1g

453,MuffinMopper,"The person who wrote this article is either biased or dumb... they are comparing trumps real estate empire to big giant companies like IBM and GMC.
 
Trump does real-estate deals.  Each of these is its own limited liability company.  So for example trump creates a company, and puts a million dollars into it for a 50% share.  He gets some other people to put in 1 million for their own 50 percent share.  The company then borrows 4 million from a bank, and builds a building.  Hopefully, they sell the building for 8 million, pay the bank back, and trump makes a nice 1.5 million profit off his 1 million dollar investment.  Not bad.
 
However, its also possible that the company will go bankrupt.  Perhaps they run into trouble finding a buyer for the building, and realize they can't make back the 5 million.  In that event trump can only lose the 1 million that he invested in the company.  This is how  finance works in American, and the entire western world.  In the above example, Trump is not going backrupt.  A company that he is a equity holder in is going bankrupt.  
 
This is not comparable to a big company like IBM going bankrupt.  Its apples and oranges.  Trump had hundreds of small companies/deals, and a few of them went bankrupt.  That is way different that trump himself going bankrupt.  The whole reason limited liability companies exists is so stuff like this can happen.  ",1441054420,cum93ha

Illegals are going to find ways to get into the country no matter what so why would he put millions of tax payer dollars on the line? Also repealing birthright citizenship is ridiculous.

Thirdly, English is the international trade language and the unofficial language of the internet. All over the world English is a high priority to know how to speak. So if you don't encourage people to learn English then you're actually doing them a grave disservice.

But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee openly.""

Also Fiorina has been jabbing him for a while and this comment that sounds like it was done outside the interview process while they were watching tv came out.

I think that's all the response he needs.  Jindal has no momentum at all..  Trump doing a back and forth with him would only give him attention he can't earn on his own merit.   Jindal is a non-entity as far as this race goes.

You can bet any of the other politicians would have picked him out of the crowd and pandered to him.  I don't think Trump thinks that way.

At one point as he exited the dallas rally through the crowd.. not by going through the sides, there was a black man with a cowboy hat on.. he had something he wanted signed and Trump walked right by him.  he shook two hands and then looked over his shoulder and saw the guy and walked back and shook his hand and had a laugh with him.

The so called good ones secretly cheer on ISIS, give money, or other aid to them, try to sign up for them, all while saying America and the west have ""satanist values"".

The respected Muslim dude who everyone in the community knew and said he was so great, you see a report on the news of him snapping one day, yelling ""aloha snackbar"" and shooting up a military recruitment center. Muslims are not doing anything to rid their religion of the evil, extremist side. They are unwilling to stand up for the reputation of their kind and do anything to help us get rid of them. You really can't differentiate the good ones from the bad ones anymore because you find out later the ones you thought you could trust stab you in the back later, as happens everytime we aid one group - Kurds, Sunnis Shiites, etc in a fight against the others. As soon as the group we help wins, they turn around and call us ""the Great Satan"" and declare jihad on us, saying crap like we desecrated ""Muslim Holy Land"" by building  military base there - when we were invited in to help. They also claim the desecration anywhere we were likely to build on so pretty much anywhere is ""muslim holy land"" to them for the purposes of accusing us later.

I am an ardent Trump supporter but this doesn't seem to strike much of a chord with me; then again I am fine with my USP for self defense.  That being said, this article doesn't even begin to approach a reasonable analysis of the facts.

""He insists that if only we paid attention to ""red flags"" (that don't rise to the level of actual crimes) and pre-emptively locked up people for curious behavior that only in retrospect is ever any kind of clear sign of ""about to kill people with a gun"" than all would be fine.""

What does that even mean?  Are they implying that people like Dylann Roof or James Holmes are not the main issue with gun crime in America?  

Okay, fine, let's say I cede that point - who said anything about locking them up?  The policy paper is about the 2nd amendment.  We are all clearly only saying we should deny these people with mental issues access to guns - no one anywhere, Trump or otherwise, implied we should lock them up like we're in Minority Report.

""Even the vast majority of those who have actually been adjudicated ""mentally ill"" in some fashion would never harm anyone else with a weapon they owned, and there isn't any obvious reason why they should be denied the right to self-defense or pleasure via gun ownership of anyone else.""

Oh, wow, the vast majority of the mentally ill won't commit gun crimes.  Excuse me while I allow the vast majority of epileptics who wouldn't have a seizure while driving to drive, etc.  What a bullshit argument.  This article literally advocates that the mentally ill should have the right to bear arms as if it's a cogent point, and because it is against Trump liberals might even accept it.  I cannot believe how absurd that is.  I'd even like the government to at least review what misdemeanors people committed before allowing a license, because I want us true law abiding citizens to be able to fully enjoy our 2nd amendment rights.  

Trump has a progressive view here to deny the mentally ill dangerous weapons, reinforce background checks and use this new legitimate system to allow us legal gun-owners to fully enjoy the 2nd amendment.  This is pretty consistent with the view of moderate democrats for the past 20 years, yet somehow this article spins it to sound like Ted Cruz just had a talk with God himself.  Am I going crazy here?

They went to Washington a few times a year to meet and debate laws and legislation, then went back home to their day jobs. They got a little pay for their work in Washington but their real income came from back home. 

Elected officials don't do this anymore. They approve pay raises for themselves all the time so it's like their role as a Congressman or Senator is their ""day job"" now, and their medical practice, or law firm or whatever back home is just supplemental income in case they do bad enough to be voted out. That's what corrupts them, that's why they only care about issues and looking good before an election. The rest of the time once they're elected, they just try to do just good enough not to have a major scandal and hope that anything bad they do is done and blown over early enough so by the next election people forget.

Trump is doing the right thing by eliminating that enticement of money either from lobbyist donations now, or a salary as president. When the money isn't a motivator anymore, maybe people will actually concentrate *on* their job, not trying to keep it.",1442924346,cva3b7m

Pushing legislation through requires compromise and if you slap a budget down saying this is final, you will be blamed when it does not get accepted. 

Just look at how the media castigated the GOP when Obama refused to pass the budget. It was not reported that they just wanted to delay the mandate, but they were being obstructionist. Obama even thought that their plan was reasonable, in fact he thought it was so good that he decided to implement what he refused to allow the budget to pass in order to fight just a few weeks later (of course rather than pass it through Congress and share 'credit', he just decided that since he was in charge of the DOJ that he could just tell them not to enforce the law and declare it invalidated, despite his Constitutional obligation).

* If the kids have scumbag parents, then the entire family will be deported.  When they are 16 or 18 or something, the kids can move back on their own.

951,vir4030,"Trump has been discussing the 14th amendment, and hinting at a legal angle to approach this issue:

&gt; All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside.

Wikipedia offers this context on the language choice:

&gt; the two exceptions to citizenship by birth for everyone born in the United States mentioned in the Act, namely, that they had to be ""not subject to any foreign power"" and not ""Indians not taxed"", were combined into a single qualification, that they be ""subject to the jurisdiction"" of the United States

So I think that Trump would argue that they are not citizens, and he can deport them all at any time.  Then I would expect him to offer them the opportunity to correct the problem.  This would involve paying back taxes and achieving at least a minimum standard of education that we expect from random legal immigrants.  People have to apply, and they have to be sponsored, typically, in order to legally come here.  So I would say this means the following criteria:

- Pay any back taxes owed.  Although many of these people make less than $25,000 / year, Trump's tax plan can't be retro-active.  They may owe back taxes, and they need to declare their income and pay their taxes, if necessary.

- Get a GED or High School Diploma from an accredited school.  Children who are already going to school have to finish High School in a timely fashion.  Adults have to enroll in a GED program.  They must make reasonable progress towards completion, and the institution is effectively their sponsor.

- Have a clean criminal record.  If at any time they are convicted of a crime, they forfeit the process.

- Pay for their application ($680), plus a $100 fine.  Waive this for people with United States birth certificates.

- Renounce citizenship of all other countries.

Just make a special line for citizenship just for these people.  There will be a waiting period until they are 21 years old and 7 years from their application date.  At the end of the period, if they have paid all their taxes, paid their fine, gotten their GED or diploma, and renounced other citizenships, they will become a citizen.

Then apply a cutoff date, say one year from the law passing.  After that, we may not need to do much deporting - except criminals.  Maybe build a new federal processing and holding center to house these people until we can negotiate with their own countries for their return.",1443478671,cvhemwp

To provide a detailed example, suppose someone makes 200k/year.  
 
* They pay zero tax on the first 25000.
* They pay 10% on the next 25001 to 50000 = 2500 tax
* They pay 20% on 50001 to 15000 = 20000 tax
* they pay 25% on 150001 to 200000 = 12500 tax.

So if you make $26,000 - you pay zero percent on the first $25k, then 10% on the next $1k.  So your taxes would be $100.

I think what Trump is saying is let's build up like crazy on all fronts, regroup and come back swinging later with a super powerful and shored-up military or via making deals and using leverage against Putin or even work with him. Trump even said he strongly believes in military technology and this is part of his strategy to build up our military. I agree--America already rocks at defense research. We should focus more on that. America's military truly is state-of-the-art and of the future--just like Israel. Perhaps develop orbital weapons and further our control of space--the ultimate high ground so we don't even have to use our military by virtue of deterrence.  But a lot of Trump's foreign policy is based on him being unpredictable, which is always good, but by its nature is kind of mysterious to us speculating.

At the next debate, there will be a bunch of discussion about free trade, and its costs and benefits.  It will be interesting to see how trump manhandles people.  I suspect it will go like this:
 
* TRUMP: You guys passed a deal which benefits everyone except the United States.  Sweaty Rubio with his free water out there bankrupted the working man.  
* RUBIO: Free trade benefits all people.  Have you not heard of comparative advantage?
* TRUMP: That only works under free trade conditions.  What we have here is not free trade.  Its a benefit for everyone else, and a deficit for the united states.  Do you know they aren't even doing anything about currancy maniuplation?!  How could you losers leave that out!
* RUBIO:  Well at least is something.  Its better than what we had.  If you had any political experience you would know that you can't always get everything you want in a deal.
* TRUMP:  You mean YOU can't get everything you want in a deal.  I don't sign bad deals.  A bad deal is worse than no deal at all 100% of the time.

Heck, they're perfectly adult, fair, political questions for somebody running for Village Treasurer!

If there's anything about this election that scares me, it's the number of people who not only don't care whether or not Hillary is a lawbreaker (and it's not like ""the email server"" is the only thing!), but also seem to think it's somehow beyond the pale to care or talk about it.

What exactly does she have to do to disqualify herself as a candidate? Get up on stage and simply flat-out tell everyone that she does not believe laws apply to her? Kill someone on national television and thumb her nose at the entire audience?

Anyone who would even consider voting for Hillary at this juncture, I do not want to hear _one word_ about either Bush ever again from you. And in the event a Republican wins, I forbid you from complaining about any violation of the law you may believe he or she may have committed, because you have demonstrated _you don't really care_. Not even a little. Not even enough to vote for _a different Democrat_ without these massive problems. Your actions prove you don't care one tiny little bit whether authority figures obey the law.

~40% of the country doesn't actually care. _That's_ scary.

And if you don't like that characterization of yourself... well, maybe you should change it. It's perfectly OK to care about whether Hillary has broken the law without having to stop being a Democrat, or think ""womenz are badz"" or anything else. You don't have to change a single other thing about yourself or your self image. You just have to choose to care whether or not people who have been granted massive, massive amounts of responsibility and power should also follow the law, and then let that care flow out into your real actions in the real world.

&gt; Trump went on to foul off the pitch and then quickly turn to another questioner.

&gt; The GOP establishment, already reeling from the surprise defeat of former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in Virginia last year and the announcement late last month that John Boehner will soon give up both his House seat and his speakership, has been caught flat-footed by the rise of Trump and the other nonprofessional politicians and is desperately seeking a way to stop them.

&gt; So the GOP is now facing its worst nightmare: What if Trump is for real? That behind all the bluster, beneath the weird hair, is a guy who just might be able to clean out the Augean stables of the Permanent Bipartisan Fusion Party that continues to cling to power in Washington.

- Not sure about TSA
- Generally supports the Patriot Act
- Maximum firepower, maximum preparedness, american interests come first, address all possible threats - pretty tough on homeland security

Personally, he prides himself on never touching drugs, alcohol, or even coffee after watching alcohol claim the life of his late brother.

**Private Prisons:** He hasn't talked about private prisons at all during the campaign, as far as I know.  The left has made a mountain out of a molehill with this issue, considering that private prisons only represent about 9% of the US prison population.

**Police:** Trump condemns police brutality, which he has said is a ""massive crisis,"" while still being very supportive of a strong law enforcement system.

**NSA Surveillance / Patriot Act:** Trump's stance on the NSA is one of my only huge disagreements with him.  He's pro-NSA, I'm anti-NSA.  But in fairness, he frames it as more of a necessary evil (though I don't think it even qualifies as that).  He also agreed with the US Appeals Court's ruling against the bulk data program back in May and wants greater oversight.

**TSA:** Like private prisons, he simply hasn't made it a big issue in his campaign.

**Homeland Security:** He's tough on security, but with an eye towards deal-making (diplomacy) first.  He realizes that we can't afford to be the world police anymore.

**The Fed:** Trump has been very critical of the Fed, especially on interest rates.  He cites Paul Volcker, who actually reduced the money supply, as his favorite Fed chairman.  He has also expressed interest in returning to the gold standard at some point.",1445295696,cw5pu4u

&gt; ""The owner’s servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn’t you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'

&gt; ""'An enemy did this,' he replied.

&gt; ""The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'

&gt; ""'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'""

Ronald Reagan was the master who sowed. The master of the harvest will be President Trump.

There are plenty of examples. Here is one: her stance on guest workers. In early 2000's, she argued the H-1B program should be expanded and America's were not entitled to jobs on American soil. In 2015, she is saying maybe it's not a great idea. ",1445471550,cw898l9

First they ignored us. Then they laughed at us. They now realize they must fight us. We know they will lose because their arguments are based on fear, lies, and intimidation. By arguing with truth and determination we will make them expose themselves as the tyrants they are, and our fellow citizens will join us.

Hold strong. The justness of our cause, and the [dankness of our memes](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/653856168402681856) will carry us through to victory. God bless Donald J. Trump, and God bless the United States of America.

&gt; In an interview on the 100th consecutive day he has led in national polls - and approaching 100 days before the opening Iowa caucuses - Trump was more than willing to opine on the big issues that would face a presidential nominee and a president.

&gt; &amp;quot;Well, I think I know more about national security than he does,&amp;quot; Trump replies.

&gt; This week four more national polls showed Trump ahead. In the ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Trump&amp;#039;s support was at 32%, trailed by retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson at 22% and Florida senator Rubio at 10%. Former Florida governor Bush, crowned by some as a front-runner before the race began, has dropped to a stunning fourth place and 7%. Trump has now held the lead longer than the string of up-and-down contenders in 2012 - Herman Cain, Michele Bachmann, Newt Gingrich - and has held it more consistently than Mitt Romney, who become the nominee.

Sweden has an poverty rate of a mere 3.7%, compared to the United States [14%](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poverty_in_the_United_States)

&gt;Sweden is the rape capital of the West, second only to Lesotho worldwide.

I don't know what point you're trying to make by linking that, there are many factors that could be involved such as a higher conviction rate, and different laws involved.

&gt;Sweden has a far higher suicide rate.

Yes? The United States has a [far higher suicide rate than Mexico and Greece](http://puu.sh/kVdFj/b03394176b.png) does that make them better countries to live in?

&gt;Until you need an operation - then you face up to a year in wait times. Maybe that's why they're privatizing it.

If the healthcare system in Sweden is so bad, than how come Sweden has the [9th Highest Life Expectancy of every country on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy), and the United States is ranked at [34th](http://puu.sh/kVdW7/86d570fd85.png). The Healthcare system in Sweden is also [far cheaper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_(PPP)_per_capita) than in the US, with better outcomes. How do you explain this?

&gt;Wrong.

I concede this point.

&gt;Also wrong - the US has the richest middle class in the world.

Linking anecdotal articles does not serve well to prove your point. [Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States) is an article to counter your article.

&gt; The existence of these super PACs - with names like Make America Great Again and the Art of the Deal - did not match Trump&amp;#039;s campaign promise to self-finance his campaign and only accept small donations that are limited by federal law.

&gt; The Post reported this week that Trump&amp;#039;s campaign has paid two firms connected to Ciletti, a longtime associate of Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski.

&gt; Ciletti said Thursday that he did not receive the donor contact information &amp;quot;From anyone employed by the Trump Organization or the Trump campaign,&amp;quot; but refused to say how he obtained it.

&gt; Had Trump rivals Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio been present when Trump entered the room - flashing his smile, shaking hands indiscriminately, with everyone rushing to find their phones to capture this rare moment - they wouldn&amp;#039;t be laughing.

&gt; They&amp;#039;re not alone: The RealClearPolitics average of Florida polling shows Trump leading Ben Carson, the second-ranking Republican, by eight points, and Rubio and Bush by at least 10.

&gt; Trump&amp;#039;s dominance in Florida is all the more surprising given the high expectations surrounding Bush and Rubio, and in light of Trump&amp;#039;s strongly anti-immigrant rhetoric - which would seem incompatible with Florida&amp;#039;s robust Hispanic population.

Although Carson is riding a few high Iowa polls, I expect that his numbers will arc and fall the same way Fiorina's did.  Trump's core of support is much more solid than Carson's or anyone else's, and comes from outside the realm of normal caucusgoers.

The claim that there are ""no American-born skilled IT workers who can do the jobs American companies need"" is flat out absurd. The fact is that companies don't want to pay a reasonable wage to an American worker, they'd rather import work on a contract/project by project basis and pay in some cases half what they would have to pay for an American. It's just a dodge to pay skilled workers enough to make a decent living. The result is 2nd or 3rd rate work done by inadequately skilled workers, sloppy code, broken software and so-called ""experts"" that only memorized the answers to their certification test manuals and, though they passed, constantly fail to critically think on their own without constantly needing to frantically flip through their test manuals for example code on how to do something.

Companies don't care about quality. They care more about being cheap and delivering a product first before their competition. Then they corner customers into signing up for  ""extended support contracts"" while they fix screw ups they should have ironed out before product release. 

Instead of hiring foreigners, how about paying a decent wage and hiring the many qualified workers who just graduated some of our best schools? How about investing in training for your workers? There's no reason to assume workers ""just come"" with all the skills you need and are plug and play. In many cases, you NEED to invest at least the first 6 months on-boarding any new IT professional. They have to learn your stack, your systems, your procedures, your schedules, any proprietary software you may use. They will never be ready on day 1.

The excuse that there are not enough engineers out there is complete bullshit. There's no way companies are being forced to rampantly hire from overseas. There should be strict regulations on H1B.

They had facebook groups that were setup to share old exams, quizes, homework solutions, codes, all all kinds of other stuff ONLY for other Asian international students. Americans were never let into these groups and I wouldn't join given the chance. A few of them still ask me to vouch for them so they can get a job at companies I used to work for and I don't do it. In school, they cheated all the time and plagiarized the HELL out of homework and group reports. I remember the international student in my senior design group.

3.) Trump has his $6.5 billion wall... people don't believe it. I don't blame them. But, Trump is missing the mark because: every child in the US public education system costs ~11k in tuition. We have DREAMERs and BCR. We could deport 550,000 of these kids and we would save **$6.5 billion/YEAR in US Dept Edu money**. And deport another, idk 50k, to offset deportation costs. 

Every BCR costs approximately $130,000 in ""tuition"" total PER CHILD (13 years *10k). &lt;- I used 10K because it fluctuates from year to year. You get my point.

I know it seems heartless to deport children. But, you could have parents call or follow the kid, or have the kid take you to the parent, and deport the family. And, schools know which children are illegal. Finding them is easier.

So I asked them why they thought this and they said he was racist because he wanted to kick them out. So I asked them if they were legal; they said yes. So I said don't worry because he doesn't care about y'all. Then he asked why trump said all Mexicans were rapists. I pretty much face palmed and then explained how that was taken out of context and he was only talking about how the broken border is letting in criminals and rapists.

5) We have a humanitarian crisis along our border. Hard working Mexican immigrants are funneled across to live in fear of deportation while they're exploited for profit by heartless businesses.

2) Objectively state the man is not a racist. He was clearly discussing crime in the context of *illegal immigration*, and ""illegal immigrant"" is not a race.

3) You know this man is not a racist. In his career he has worked with, made deals with, and employed people of every race color and creed and gotten along with them all. It makes no sense for him to be a racist. The only reason to call him a racist is to malign the character of a good man to score cheap, PC points, and you should be ashamed of yourself for doing so.

4) With regards to ""who's doing the raping,"" that's a good question. [80% of women are raped during their border crossing](http://www.inquisitr.com/1471437/central-american-women-crossing-u-s-border-are-raped-80-percent-of-the-time/). Why don't you care? Why don't you want to help them? President Trump does. Because he has a heart.

5) When appropriate, refer to The Donald as ""President Trump."" Also use superlatives. ""Great man."" ""Huge heart."" ""Most beautiful family."" ""Make America Great Again."" Make the opposition angry because they have to argue with opinions, and they cannot win a battle of opinions, because they're just opinions. They'll sound like assholes insulting the guy's family. 

6) Remember your target is not the person you're arguing with. It's the other 1000 people who come along afterwards and read it who do not already have their minds made up. You may not be religious, but I highly, highly, recommend taking a few minutes to read your Gospels. Read them as manuals for overthrowing an entrenched and corrupt power structure (i.e., the washington establishment and their thralls on /r/politics). Look at the way Jesus spoke to different people in different ways at different times. 

Pay particular attention to the way he spoke to the Pharisees. He was NEVER trying to convert the Pharisees. You can't! Those guys are bad. They already know the truth, and know they're lying, and don't want to change. That would undermine their power. Jesus' goal was to troll them to ask and answer questions in certain ways that the *crowd* would come to realize on their own that the Pharisees were bad guys and there was something special about Jesus. Do like that. But you can't just tell somebody ""you're wrong!"" and get into a shouting match with them. Never works.

7) Do not get dragged down into details. No one reading the exchange will understand them anyway. Your opponent will just blind everyone with bullshit and then declare victory. Instead, stick to simple principles. There's a reason Trump speaks to crowds at a 4th grade level. It's not because he's dumb, it's because he's smart.

Here's my go-to, ""why do you like Trump?"" response. Feel free to use or modify it:
------

1) He's a good man. How do I know? Because he makes good things. We haven't had a good man in a long time.

2) He can't be bought. The rest of the candidates are bought.

3) He's a pragmatist. He's about what works, not about what he thinks is right. Lord save us from those who have all the answers. I haven't seen a pragmatist since Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. The rest are ideologues who can never compromise, or simply crooks.

Carson does not have enough people on the ground to run a serious campaign. Yet. Maybe that can change. But he's lacking the infrastructure.

He is doing very well in Iowa, because his super pac's have joined forces and spent almost all of their money there. Trying to get an early primary win and use that momentum. And of course the media loves any poll that Donald isn't winning. But this is not reflective of national support, which Donald is still dominating.

Fortunately, Carson doing well is good for Donald. It robs the other candidates of much needed oxygen. Rubio, Cruz, and Jeb are going to have a hard time getting any support when over 55% of the party will only vote for an outsider. 

When he drops out, I think Carson's voters will go 50/50 to Trump and whoever is left, possibly more if the other outsider is a strong evangelical. 

But Trump should consider, and i think he has, getting Ben on his ticket. That would be the dream ""outsider"" campaign that has been resonating, and would clinch the evangelical and black vote.

2237,kevinhesswrites,"Hi bleakmidwinter,

I'm for Donald Trump and I'll tell you a little bit about why.

First off, full disclosure, I wrote a book about Donald Trump.  It's called [Donald Trump: A Culture Of Conflict](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B016PHGQ8Q/) and it just came out last week.  I talk about the first 100 days of Trump's campaign, and how he is defeating expectations and defying political gravity due to his superior management of conflict and media presence.  He wins just about every fight he picks, and I explain how.  The book isn't an outright plug for Trump so much as it is an analysis of how his campaign worked.  It's really classy and top-notch.  *plug over*

Trump's seeming impermiability to scandal actually fascinated me a lot as I began to watch his campaign, and I started paying more attention to him for laughs at first.  Then I realized he wasn't joking around and he was the real deal.  Some of his positions I don't agree with--Edward Snowden, opposing the estate tax are two examples.  I'm a little ambivalent about his tax plan otherwise but I'm not extremely optimistic about it.

However, I also agree with a lot of his principles.  I think his opposition to illegal immigration is overdue and in everyone's best interests.

I also like him from a personality perspective.  As someone else mentioned, I see Trump as a pragmatist first and an idealogue dead last.  Since he owes no political favors to anyone, Trump is free to use this pragmatism to implement policy that benefits more than just the donor class.  This is where Trump's ego comes into play - I'm convinced that Trump's ego is big enough for him to want to be the best president in the history of the United States.  That's the kind of guy I want working for the nation, not someone who's meek and humble.

Furthermore, Trump is by every account an absolutely ferocious negotiator.  Nobody's ever come out and said he was a marshmallow.  That's the kind of brainpower I want running the country and making judgments on who serves in his cabinet.

So, there's a few reasons why I want Trump as president.  It's not because he's the perfect candidate.  But he looks very, very good.  He could turn out to be a horrible president.  I'm willing to risk it",1446521651,cwmgv0r

2249,jerf,"If Trump was concerned about this, he'd be acting on that concern. Instead, he's been fairly polite to Carson.

IMHO, Carson fits into the pigeonhole that the media spent a lot of time trying to stuff Trump into, the flash-in-the-pan protest candidate that is polling at near-0 by the time the primaries actually roll around. Outsider is one thing, and he's smart and all, but I really can't help but think that once he's in office, he'd just drown. As the vote gets closer I suspect a lot more people will be thinking about that sort of thing. I think it's a lot of why the flash-in-the-pan candidates so rarely go anywhere. My guess is that in a lot of ways the only reason he's polling even as high as he is is that Trump has broken the seal on considering outsider candidates; in a race without Trump I'd expect he's simply unknown.

My read is that Trump is not that concerned, and that Carson's still considered a potential VP. (Where he probably would do fine, if not great. VP is a very different job.)",1446560376,cwmv1gs

Going to and from Canada is the most arduous process I have ever gone through, and was leagues harder than when I traveled to Juarez, Mexico from El Paso and back. First of all, Canadian customs shook our car down and then brought the dogs out. Then they told my girlfriend's brother that he was not allowed in the country due to him having a DUI 8 years ago. Then they sent us back to USA, where our customs made us, Americans, go through customs for a whopping 2 hours where they too brought the dogs and heckled us with tons of questions. We are all white Americans and had passports and all. 

Juarez? There was no Mexican customs when walking, you just paid some guy a couple of pesos in a booth. Going through with car they did have some people there but the security was equally pathetic. Going back to US, we didn't have passports only ID cards. They asked a few questions and didn't check anything and just let us through .

&gt; When Donald Trump hosted &amp;quot;Saturday Night Live&amp;quot; in 2004, he held forth in multiple sketches, like a spoof of &amp;quot;Regis and Kathie Lee&amp;quot; and a fake ad for &amp;quot;Donald Trump&amp;#039;s House of Wings.&amp;quot; In 2015, the show was considerably more stingy with his time.

&gt; Though Trump carried the opening monologue and appeared in the entirety of the show&amp;#039;s second sketch of the evening, he was not allowed to carry any segment of the program on his own.

&gt; On &amp;quot;Weekend Update,&amp;quot; Bobby Moynihan&amp;#039;s &amp;quot;Drunk Uncle&amp;quot; character praised some of Trump&amp;#039;s ideas, but Trump was not on hand to express them himself.

2732,ghostalker47423,"Optimal would be Clinton, hands down, for the following reasons:

* She has a long political career full of flip-flopping. O'Malley and Sanders are both calling her out on it already, and their voices will be silenced if she gets the nomination. Trump is in a perfect political position to keep the heat on her.

* Her history in the Obama administration gives plenty to scrutinize too.

* Her responses are scripted. Granted she's got a lot of them ready to say, Donald has proven himself unpredictable... and there's nothing worse for someone with canned results than an opponent who is unpredictable.

* She represents the Democratic establishment. Donald on the other hand does **not** represent the Republican establishment. That's attractive to moderates and fringe-voters. Furthermore, if Sanders doesn't get the nomination, a lot of his supporters aren't going to vote for Clinton... but are willing to be politically active. I doubt they'd put the same effort into Trumps campaign as they are Sanders, but they'll vote.

I see a bunch of people here saying Sanders would be an easier target. I agree in principal, but not in tactics. Here's why:

* His base is very, very loyal. Attacking Sanders just riles them up even more. It's not your standard political dogfight. The first time Hillary sent an attack ad his way, they just gave more money. Granted that's not an issue for Donald, but if people are giving money to Sanders, they're already in his corner. The goal should be to reduce their confidence in their candidate, because attacking him just makes him stronger to his supporters.

* Calling him a socialist? It's not effective when he proudly wears the term. Again, his supporters don't care. Playing this card just makes them back him even more. It's counter-productive. The people already opposed to him already associate him with the word, so what good does it do? 

* He doesn't have the same quantity or quality political baggage as Clinton. Most his bills never get anywhere in Congress (which is an angle people have been bringing up, and it's a valid argument), but a failed bill isn't as newsworthy as a private server with classified information on it, that wasn't properly secured. Who cares about a Vermont Senator trying to name Post Offices when the former Secretary of State conveniently forgot about data security... in an age where China is hacking into everything with an Ethernet connection.

Going against Clinton would be the best scenario. Trump has an excellent offense, and Clinton isn't used to adapting (both on her stances and in regards to her campaign). She has too much ground to cover, a divided party behind her (whom most associate her with the term ""untrustworthy""), and poor defense. Granted, she'll rile up the female vote because that's what *makes her different* in her words, but that's not enough. Trump excels at calling it like he sees it, and when Clinton has an image problem like she does now, Trump will pounce on it and the voters will cheer in support.

Remember that an election is akin to a war, an information war. Know your strengths and that of your opponents. Put your personal feelings aside and look at the bigger picture. Identify your opponents weaknesses and your own, then figure out how to shore up your own defenses and how to poke holes in the opposition. Going off full-throttle against an opponent is not always the path to victory.",1447171999,cwvextz

He also said ""we're building a wall and Mexico is going to pay for it"" and that has now been accepted a legitimate position. Consider that. He proposed a *yuge* bold idea that nobody said could get done and was mocked for it; now they talk about ""ok but how are you going to deport all these people"". He's actively selling ideas that are considered political suicide by pundits on both sides of the aisle, and he's winning.

The question then becomes: at what point is it more conservative (both fiscally *and* socially, as stripping families apart does nothing but harm to those involved) to have them come out of the shadows, fine them, tax their income, and have them go through a delayed process to legal status? If it's going to cost upwards of $150 billion (some have said up to $300 billion over *decades*), would it not make more sense to fine and tax them going forward? They still wouldn't be eligible for certain benefits until they reach legal status, which under some plans could take up to a decade, but they would be paying additional taxes on top of what they are paying now, and we wouldn't have a literal group of armed soldiers rounding up families in towns and cities across the US.

Companies pay what they feel represents the employee's value to the company. If they say burger flipping is worth $5/hr, well then you have two choices: keep working there and take it, or go work for their competition that pays better. Eventually the low paying company will have to raise their wages to keep up with high turnover or go out of business. That's how free market works. If you refuse to keep up with the competition, or simply cannot, your business will fail. 

Many small businesses simply cannot afford the mandated regulations, the mandatory obamacare, sick leave, benefits, pensions, entitlements. The business owner started the business to make money for himself, not to give you a job. Hiring you was a necessary evil because you had a skill he needed, or simply couldn't run the place by himself. Does that mean he owes you big time? No. Does that mean your problems financially outside of work - can't afford to live off the salary - are his problems? No. If you don't think you can make it with that job, you get yourself in gear and pick up your skills and go look for a better job. Insurance, vacation, bonuses are *perks* of working there, if the boss can afford to do that. 

The government does not need to be involved in wage determination. The market will take care of it. Fixing a wage floor just adds unnecessary oversight the business owner doesn't need.

Basically, something which translates for the owner.....better skill = more profits.

We could suggest a certain hospital/school/police station quota dependant upon the population in each city. The Mexican leaders maintain their own bureaucratic sovereignty, but must submit to the American Constitution. 

We should keep Mexico unified as one state. Division in Mexico, even to the extent of a few states, will cause unrest with the drug cartels. If one state in Mexico is a bit more lax with drug laws, the druglords will pile into that state. There are 4x as many leaders in a once unified state, which is sure to cause unrest.

&gt; Less than three months before the kickoff Iowa caucuses, there is growing anxiety bordering on panic among Republican elites about the dominance and durability of Donald Trump and Ben Carson and widespread bewilderment over how to defeat them.

&gt; At a campaign event in Springfield, Ill., Donald Trump attacked rival Ben Carson over claims about Carson&amp;#039;s violent youth and suggested a boycott of coffee giant Starbucks over the design of its Christmas coffee cups.

&gt; One well-funded outside group, the Club for Growth, has aired ads attacking Trump in Iowa and more recently came out against Carson as well.

I respect Hillary supporters.  I just feel like a lot of them are older, anti-egalitarian feminists who want Hillary to win the nomination, facts be damned.  It's hard to talk and understand Hillary supporters without being acutely aware of this.

I respect Sanders supporters a lot, especially their push for civility.  I just feel like a lot of them are too caught up in the cult of personality behind Sanders, and that many of them support the exact same type of misapplied philosophy that empowers the older demographic that supports Hillary.

I respect Trump a lot.  I may not agree with everything he says, but he is the guy I want to win the presidency.  Because in a way he has helped me find my identity as an American.  Baudrillard refers to Reagan (who I respect, and so does Obama) condescendingly as ""hyper real"", but I find Trump to be ""real real"".  Maybe one day /r/politics will completely grok what this means.

But no.

I'll also observe that it's interesting that this information is being released so quickly, rather than having feet dragged and everything dribbled out around endless exhortations to not jump to the conclusion that it was ISIS. Even the front page of CNN has been beaten into submission on this point. It's a total reality-induced narrative collapse. I'm sure it'll be partially reassembled after the shock wears off, but it'll be a year or two before it can seal over this, and that would require the active cooperation of ISIS to not launch any more attacks in that period.

He's still betting that Trump won't make it and he's positioning himself to be the natural home for those supporters when they look for it, hence his 100% agreement. Also, I bet that he thinks Trump would have a hard time going against the Hilldawg machine and doesn't want to risk being the VP on a losing ticket.

It's easy to forget this from our position in November, 2015, but generally speaking, history has little memory of the _primaries_.

And nobody will go ""Oh, but he lost the primaries in 2016!""

Right now, basic politics forbids Cruz from saying he'd do it. He's currently running for the Presidency, and can't show weakness by saying anything about the VP position any more than Trump can get up and say who he'd be willing to the be the VP _for_.

This is despite the fact that at one point in 2009 or 2008 the financial system was about 3 hours away from completely shutting down.  Meaning your checking account and debit card wouldn't allow you to withdraw funds, and your credit cards wouldn't lend you money.

There was a ask reddit thread a while back asking people why they supported Trump, and one comment on it perfectly explains why many of us support him. 

&gt;Because over time our entire political system has become a complete joke. It's completely based on money. And these are just the popular mantras, but after 30 something years on this planet, I've decided they're true, but for specific reasons.
No one involved in the White House or on the Hill has an actual ""job"" like they used to when the country was founded. Being a Senator or a Rep used to be be something else you did, not the only thing you did. You didn't get paid a livable salary to come to DC, and you didn't spend all year (minus vacations) in the city, you were at home, in your home state, doing your job. You ran a store, you were a farmer, a doctor, a butcher or some shit. Entire lifetimes are spent in office...why? How is that reality? Every single one of them is a millionaire...how does that represent anyone? How can they possibly relate to a huge swath of the country? The districts at a state/local level are absolute dogshit, carved up literally block by block in some arbitrary fashion that negates the effectiveness of being represented in the first place. And the term ""middle class"" is completely meaningless. There is no definitive line that says 'above this, you are middle class, but above this, you are rich'. It's an impossible to define completely meaningless term that does nothing but make everyone feel like a unique and special snowflake...the ""average american citizen"" snowflake. 40% of our income, out of the gate, goes directly to the Government. In addition to all the consumption taxes we pay (sales tax, property tax, gas tax, estate tax, capital gains tax, and on, and on, and on), and yet these idiots aren't even marginally close to HALF of a balanced budget.
They trundle out on tv, radio, in the paper, and talk about taxes, about nonsensical political moving and shaking, about topics that seem to ""matter"" but realistically make zero difference. Major headlines are made for bills about personal rights, privacy, and a slew of other things, and then completely negated by riders on other bills under the radar, piece by piece, until the people that paid for the influence get what they originally wanted anyways. The entire voting populace, which is what, a third of the eligible voters that are alive and mentally coherent at any given November, are given the illusion of having a say, when it doesn't matter. They call, they put Facebook posts up, they put signs and banners on, send stupid emails, write letters...'we're making a difference!'. No, you're not. You're killing time, like knitting, but more social, and you don't have something to show for it later.
It's a COMPLETE joke. An absolute circus. Our country exists still solely by accident, and by the forward motion created in WWII by becoming one of the largest economies and military powers in the world. And with each generation, we become more entitled, less creative, less hard working, and more egocentric than the generation before. It's a fucking shit show, and these asshats get on TV and talk about jobs, the economy, and the 'good ol American dream'.
So I love Trump. I fucking love him. I wish he was actually going to run all the way to the White House instead of just fart around until the primaries like he usually does. I wish he'd take shots and get on TV and give press conferences drunk off his ass. I wish he'd tell reporters to go fuck themselves. I wish he'd treat International diplomacy like it was an episode of what's his show where he got to say ""You're Fired"". I LOVE that he pisses off all the politicians on both sides, because he's different than the good old boys (and gals) that come up year after year after year. How can he possibly be worse than what politician after politician after politician does in office? What's he going to do, piss off an ally by spying on them? Inflame enemies by attacking their countries with remote controlled planes? Spend more money than we have? Pass laws for things with good intentions, like healthcare for people who don't have it, without considering some of the gigantic gaping holes in getting it out there...like a working website to sign up for it in the first place? Sit on his ass and do nothing while OPM has the biggest leak of clandestine and TS information in the history of mankind? Bail out gigantic banks instead of busting them up after they fucked around and lost billions of dollars and screwed over half of the globe? Have the most non-secretive affair ever? Then lie about it and spend a million man hours talking about who he did or did not fuck instead of governing? Cause gas lines and shortages, fail to rescue hostages from a shithole by piss poor planning? Invade a country and blow it to shit without figuring out how to get back out of said country, after we just did the same thing 40 years prior?
Seriously...how the fuck could Trump be WORSE than the parade of human turds in suits that march into the Capitol and White House every day, every year? He can't. He can't possibly. But the sheer fact that he's universally hated by every one of those lying out of touch idiots makes me want to vote for him as King let alone President. Go Trump.
EDIT: Jesus. Glad it got everyone talking. I posted actual ideas in another comment, but I still stand by the big T, not because he's any 'better' than the system in place, but because he breaks all the unspoken rules that are clearly flawed in the system. Moving to the DC area, it became abundantly clear quite quickly that our Govt is bananas; their day to day in no way reflects normal humans outside this city. No, I'd be an awful President. But the fact that these jabronies get on TV every year and pretend like they're not crazy needs to stop. Send the Don to the White House, maybe they'll figure out what we really think about them.

I would google/check archives in:

 Howard Stern (Trump was an early Stern celebrity supporter/friend, back when Stern was hated/blacklisted from the media/Hollywood ""scene""): he was a frequent aand well liked/respected call-in guest on Stern in the 80s/90s- you can hear DJT speak off the cuff on MANY social issues. Remember Stern was listened to daily by tens of MILLIONS of people all over the country (and I think like 20-30% of everyone in NYC/Philly. 

The New York Post, The Daily News, New York Newsday, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The (Newark) Star Ledger, The Bergen/NJ Record, Thr Philadelphia Enquirer: you can probably find some celebrity coverage in the NYC tabloids(Post/News), business/real estate coverage in the broadsheets(NJ papers, NYT/WSJ).

The Amsterdam news is I believ the longest running Black newspaper in the country- I would check there for his relationship with the Black community/media- in fact I am going to check out their archives myself- thanks for the inspiration!

Anyway, if you do a few searches and read a few interviews/stories, you will probably be able to get a feel for the man. It's like reading a candidate's ""public life""-yearbook.

I've been trying to get a better picture of it all lit up but it would require pulling over during rush hour on a busy interstate and dealing with trying to get a photo through traffic, or driving onto what is probably private property (the sign itself looks like it's on a leased section of property adjacent to a substation of the local power company, probably impossible to legally get near where it is from that side).

Besides being a blowhard, Trump doesn't have any experience governing, which is vastly different from running a company.

my guess is that you claim you are not a 1 issue voter but that is a lie. i would guess that trump's stance on immigration has a personal meaning to you. i would bet that is the 1 issue about trump that has made up your mind. even though you clearly are ignorant to truth about what he has actually said. instead, you have decided this based on highly edited news clips. i pity you.",1447969683,cx66rl8

So you're just going to believe the people that are trying to do nothing more than cause fear in you? Them saying that they have thousands of agents is a fucking lie.

Rubeo might win Florida?  Trump is ahead of him by 18 points.

I'm confident that the reason we haven't seen any polls out of Iowa is that they're good news for Trump.

These polls aren't a public service.  Th polls are commissioned and paid for by people, either universities, news publications, or candidates.

The universities and news organizations make theirs public while the candidates keep their results in-house.  

Since Trump went on his ""tirade"" ,as they called it, on Carson in Iowa and presented Iowans with the options of support Carson and be stupid or do not support him his numbers have gone up at the expense of Carson.   That's what I think. 

This is where Trump is at a disadvantage.   He has said many times, ""why pay for polls when one is released every week.?""  and that was true..  but now those polls aren't being released every week.  Just the same way his every performance isn't shown live on tv anymore (he needs to do positive ads in early states and go negative hard if attacked.) they are now taking sometimes a month to publish a new poll out of Iowa.

Trump is winning Iowa.   

the whole slant of the write-up in ""hot air"" was from the rhino narrative that the undesirable front-runner and the unelectable candidate etc etc.

Because theres no possible way for europe to incentivize having a family. yeah real kind of those immigrants to do those jobs while also recieving free housing, food, water, internet transportation and welfare on the taxpayers dime. Im sure the people dont mind the raised taxes at all. Especially not the one who were evicted to make room for refugees. and certainly not the german women that were raped by the people they're paying to prop up. meanwhile, at the highest immigration has been in decade, Sweden is the ""rape capitol of europe"" and reports of rape are rising all over the rest of europe. but thats just coincidence, Im sure. 
&gt;So you're going to brush off an attempt to hold an arguement with you as a ""Dirty Liberal Trick""?

Yup. Because it was. You tried to discredit my arguments by labeling me a racist, and I said nothing about race whatsoever.
&gt;So you're just going to believe the people that are trying to do nothing more than cause fear in you? Them saying 
that they have thousands of agents is a fucking lie.

Killing people is more than just causing fear. The day after obama said ISIS was ""contained"", we had the paris attacks, so how do you know it IS a lie when the country with the most advanced intelligence agencies, was wrong? what else were they wrong about? lie or not they can kill ten times their numbers. They've already shown that, and they'll do it again.
&gt;Believe it or not, THERE ARE OTHER FUCKED UP COUNTRIES TOO.

maybe so, but these people stopped being ""refugees"" the second they kept walking after arriving in the FIRST SAFE COUNTRY they set foot in. And big surprise, they all flood to germany which has the most generous welfare system. and what do they do when they get there? they complain that their money isn't getting mailed fast enough, that the free food isn't good enough, and that the internet isn't fast enough.

&gt;Also, if most of them aren't syrian, doesn't that help my case that we don't need to worry about terrorists as much?

Your implying that there aren't radicals in these other muslim countries which are under sharia law. they aren't going to just denounce the religious values of their home countries after they've spent their whole lives being told that ""these are the true values of islam"" more over, do you think theres no risk in bringing in thousands of people who come from a place where rape, pedophilia and public executions of homosexuals are both legal and common? Refugees get into the country, many of them have radical religious views due to their harsh countries they grew up in. ISIS sneaks in along side the refugees and recruits as many of the radicals as they can, using the fact that the quran says its the duty of all muslims is to spread islam and sharia throughout the world and that ISIS fights to do just that. the whole process is both a recruitment opportunity, and a way for ISIS to spread further across Europe, and to the U.S. More immigration is EXACTLY what they want.",1448173739,cx8szku

This is the problem I have with some politicians, what they say sounds great on face value.  But if you research the issues on your own time, you'll find what they are saying is easily dismissed.

I understand the 'one is enough' mindset and I agree with you.  But I'd argue that time and money is better spent trying to find the other seven who were born and raised right here.  The seven who don't need that trojan horse.  They are a bigger threat.

2 - They do have a reason for being here.  I'm not sure if you've noticed but the Middle East is a little unstable as of late.  The fact that these people want to flee to the EU and here shows that they are looking for stability.  The reason you and I are here is because someone in our family wanted to immigrate here.  This is why America is great and this is why immigrants (like my dad from the UK) want to come here.

3 - Two posts earlier, I mentioned that refugees have either a positive or neutral effect on the economy.  Even though there will be initial costs, the overall impact will be neutral.

you don't seem to have done much research about this. you were unaware that the majority of americans do not want this to happen. you were unaware that officials have stated the refugees cant be vetted. you are not taking the comparative cost into consideration as far as moving them to the middle east or africa is concerned. you are not considering the americans that could use that money for help. you are not taking the terrorism threat seriously. you are basically saying we should do it because its nice and if we dont we are just scared mean racists who are so self centered! your ""argument"" is weak and childish.

But this is the problem I have with many republicans (this relates to Obamacare as well).  They say that it cant be done, but there are ways to do it that have been put forward.  Instead of suggesting a better way to do what is being done, they sit back and say it cant be done.  I have done research and you have done yours, the problem is its from biased sources.

3883,dondinglerthemingler,"&gt;""A military safe zone"" just puts American military lives at risk anyway

putting soldiers from the worlds most advanced and well-trained military in harms way is WORSE than putting civilians at risk? Nobody, who isn't ready to die for the protection of others, becomes a soldier.

&gt;how are millions of fucking people going to pack into a small zone in a country already controlled by ISIS?

Implying it has to be small or even in syria. it was trumps words to put it in syria, but it can be any cooporating nation in the middle east. which while im at it, why are all the refugees going to europe and the US, and not saudi-arabia and turkey where there would be no cultural tensions?

&gt;The screening process to get in this country is so extensive, no terrorist would ever think coming to the US as a refugee.

OH REALLY? So these terrorists, that have explained to us over and over again that they ""WILL ATTACK AMERICA"", would never actually come here because it takes too long??? we can screen them all we want but we have NO database of active terrorists in the middle east. They literally have to just lie, and then wait to get in. who cares if we have their name and fingerprints now? If an immigrant IS a terrorist then he's ready to die if it means taking us with him, the screening won't dissuade him. You're really going to tell me that there is no risk because you don't think they're patient enough to come here? They will, not because its quick. Because with the insanely large groups that refugees arrive in, and because so many like you thinking they would never wait through screening, Its vastly more difficult to find a terrorist posing as a refugee.

&gt;In the past 10 years, of the hundreds of thousands of refugees entering the country, only 3 have been arrested under Suspicion of terrorism. 

We've been getting a trickle of refugees in that 10 years with no actual threat from the terrorists that they would use the refugees. now they said thats exactly what they're doing. And we've gotten nothing like the 10,000 strong boatload we just recieved. ISIS members took to social media and made the threat ""american blood is the sweetest, and we will taste it soon"" right after the paris attacks, before those refugees arrived here!! then, within hours of arriving in New Orleans, several refugees ""disapeared"". Authorities DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY ARE. are you going to tell me thats not suspicious? are you gonna tell me that it was impossible for someone to have waited through the screening.

We're told the risk is low because our incompetent leaders don't see how mass islamic immigration from ""an ISIS controlled country"" is different from Catholic mexicans looking for work. They refuse to say that maybe the refugees are causing problems because every time someone does, liberal hordes rise up against them crying ""Racist"". TIMES ARE DIFFERENT. THE RISK HAS INCREASED. If the paris attacks didn't prove that to you than the only thing that will is you or someone you know getting caught in the next attack.

meanwhile, you have no response to the fact that over 70% of the ""refugees"" are LONE MEN who either leave women and children in a warzone rather than fighting ISIS, or are simply economic migrants with no reason to seek asylum. this whole conversation has been you skimming for points you could make an argument about but never actually considering any of the points you couldn't. Basically telling me the whole time that being a good person is worth dying over. A minimal risk to peoples lives is still a risk to peoples lives but its not fucking minimal anymore. The fact is that after immigration started picking up, everyones mind changed about it. And its not just the terrorist attacks. Its the spiraling rates of assault, theft, rape, and murder that immediately followed bringing these people in. The MAJORITY of U.S. and EU citizens are now against immigration and obama and merkel are quickly gaining reputations as ""failed leaders"". So if you think its ""intolerant"" for someone wanting a safe place for their family family, and if you think stopping some refugees dying is worth letting americans and europeans die, congratulations. You're a self righteous asshole with double-standards.

One day, thousands of years in the future they will be explaining in a junior high school how the great empire of America fell completely after years of being torn apart from the inside. Some brilliant little child will raise their hand and say ""But didn't they see how stupid they were being? Why when all those things happened didn't they just put an end to the things that made more bad things?"" To which the teacher will reply ""There was this thing called the Media, it brainwashed a lot of stupid people who made those with any intelligence feel like they were bad if they spoke up. They portrayed  lies, a fake way of life and made good seem bad and bad seem good. There were people who thought they were at the forefront of society who called themselves progressives, liberals and hipsters. They were the most easily brainwashed and were vocally the loudest. They also are the ones who controlled the media."" The child will then say ""OH, I get it now. They were just brainwashing themselves into their own doom."" The teacher will nod and reply ""And unfortunately, the bad guys saw their weaknesses and were opportunists themselves, taking advantage of their sheltered, weak little minds which didn't understand that not everyone wanted peace and love for all."" To which the child will reply ""Oh, so THAT's how America fell. Damn those people sure were dumb back then.""

If you're reading this, future child, just know... Many of us got it, we saw what was going on, we understood but there was basically nothing we could do about it without going to prison or being killed ourselves. When we tried to scream, we were drowned out by the loud, obnoxious morons so we stopped shouting. There was nothing we could do, we tried, but know this. We knew... We saw it all. We understood.

hahahahaha that's funny. A cooporating nation in the middle east. That's a cute idealogical dream.

&gt;They literally just have to lie

&gt;John Oliver is a leftist-shilling cunt

You clearly did not watch the entirety of the video if you believe either of those things. Watch the whole thing.

&gt; TIMES ARE DIFFERENT. THE RISK HAS INCREASED

Like what they said after 9/11? Wow, look at all the terrorist attacks that happened AFTER 9/11 to the US that were orchestrated by Islamic terrorists. So many (/s, obviously). I can tell you're going to follow with the ""but...but.. they're more organized, they own large amounts of land!"" Then wouldn't it make more sense for them not to send terrorists out here, since they have THEIR OWN BORDERS TO DEFEND? Al Qaeda attempted WAY more terrorist attacks against the US for THIS EXACT REASON.

&gt;meanwhile, you have no response to the fact that over 70% of the ""refugees"" are LONE MEN who either leave women 

Did you take economics class in high school? Of course the majority is gonna be lone men. Countries are going to accept men in favor of women and children so they can bolster their own workforce. When people immigrate from Mexico (legally or illegally) the same situation happens. They send money back to their family as support while they work in a richer country. 

OH REALLY? So these terrorists, that have explained to us over and over again that they ""WILL ATTACK AMERICA"".....

""But such a fear is misguided because the process of relocating refugees to America is very different from the way that refugees currently arrive in Europe. Syrians flown to the US will be the most heavily vetted group of people currently allowed into the US, according to the State Department.

Each candidate is vetted first by the UN’s refugee agency, and then separately by officials from the State Department, the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and the Defense Department. The process takes between 18 months and two years.

By contrast, a refugee hoping to reach Europe can pay a smuggler approximately $1,000 \(£660\) to take them in a dinghy across the six-mile-wide strait between Turkey and the Greek islands.""(http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-america-fact-from-fiction-congress)

(\^\^This wouldn't hyperlink for some reason)

Read more of that article.

&gt;our incompetent leaders 

""HURR DURR OUR LEADERS ARE INCOMPETENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH MY RADICAL PHILSOPHY""

Their incompetence explains the fact that we pulled out of a recession with them, and the fact that there have been no successful terrorist attacks from islamic terrorists in the past 14 years in the US.

&gt;then, within hours of arriving in New Orleans, several refugees ""disapeared"".

Source? I would be interested in reading about this. Then I'll refute your argument.

[Another link for you.](http://fee.org/anythingpeaceful/6-reasons-to-welcome-refugees-after-paris/) I will admit that #6 is bullshit, and #4 doesn't mean shit either, but the rest are worth taking into consideration.

&gt;the screening won't dissuade him.

You know that's bullshit just as much as I do. They're dying for a cause, a fucking stupid cause, yes, but a cause. They aren't going to take the riskiest path to get to the US that they can just for them to get arrested/executed without killing anyone. It is my personal belief that pursuing a career in the military (without being guaranteed an officer position) is idiotic. But the people that do go directly into the military are also dying for a cause. Do you think that a person would risk becoming a US soldier if they knew for a fact there was a 99% chance that they would die for nothing? They may be willing to die, but if they aren't going to pursue their cause if they know there is a massive chance that it will all be for nothing.",1448506133,cxdbo4k

3988,offthechartskimosabe,"Well, I don't know that is an official Democrat position, and I think you are kind of combining a few different points from a few different discussions about illegal immigration in your post. Kasich for instance(and most of the rest of the Repub pres field I blv) is against mass deportations, bust certainly for some kind of immigration reform and penalty/prevention of further illegal immigration.


I do think that people who are against mass deportations, are more concerned about creating another (most likely armed) or pumping up the budget, manpower and authority of an existing federal agency, that will be out on our streets with the authority to detain, search, sieze persons and property they believe(or say they believe) to be illegals. 

Think about how the TSA was set up to ""make air-travel safe from terrorists"" and look where we ended up...the LEAST shitty part about the TSA is the money we are wasting on it.


I believe DJT will get his wall, and maybe a second in the north, and I think that will be the kind of federal jobs program we need, as when the walls are done, that same agency can start working on other infrastructure we need badly to build/repair. In a world with mostly-secure borders, the corporate interests who are pretty much back-door funding the (at LEAST seasonal) illegal imigration you are talking about in agriculture and hospitality industries will have to deal with the wage issue. We, as american consumers will also have to deal with the fact that we have been enjoying prices that are subsidized by the work of exploited illegals.


Of course there are plenty of other immigration-based problems we will need to deal with, and DJT has touched on a few. For instance there are the LEGAL H1B visas for skilled workers that are being used to fire qualified highly compensated US citizens in favor of (sometimes US educated) foreign nationals (sometimes called 'insourcing') who are then paid a fraction of what a US worker is making. Of course. We could talk about this stuff all day, there are so many facets to immigration for the USA to deal with, but I have to in-source some undercooked (illegal) stuffing into my mouth- the house smells too good!

I do agree with you that we shouldn't stop all immigration ever, just regulate it. Simplify the legal immigration process into a path for temporary workers/visitors and a path for permanent migrants. Secure the border and deport all illegals. As for legal immigration, it should be like a faucet.

This is *very* common, and is called a false memory or an implanted memory. Humans are not video recorders. When we get new information about a remembered event, we re-remember the event to take into account the new information.

For instance, an interesting experiment you can do is take a group of people and arrange for them to see some interesting unexpected event (a car accident, a purse snatching, or some such). Then you ask them to describe what they saw, one by one, with each person being able to hear the others as they give their descriptions.

If you plant a few people in the group with a pre-arranged description of the event that is wrong, and call on them first, you'll find that most of the other people now believe that this wrong description of the even is right. Every time they hear someone tell a version of the event that differs from their remembered version, their remembered version has a chance of changing to match the one they just heard.

Another example, described in [this paper](https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusBernsteinInHealy05.pdf), shows how easy a false memory can be created. They had someone who knew the subject's family bring up an incident where the subject and a friend had put Slime in the teacher's desk in elementary school, got in trouble, and had to spend a half hour sitting the corner facing the wall. This was completely made up. Many subjects then ""remembered"" that incident. If subjects were also shown their class photo from that time, that boosted the rate of false memory implantation to 65%.

In another test (mentioned [here](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/how-many-of-your-memories-are-fake/281558/)), subjects were told that there was news footage of United 93 crashing in Pennsylvania on 9/11. After that, 29% of normal people, and 20% of people with Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory (basically, the kind of people that can remember most details of every day of their lives) had a false memory of having seen that news footage (which in fact does not exist).",1448610963,cxejtmv

In the case of the US' attempt to overthrow Assad in Syria, we know that the rise of ISIS was an intention of the US.  Americans don't want ""boots on the ground"" wars anymore - especially in the absence of a major attack.  So the only way to defeat these guys is to arm and train ""rebels"" to do it.  And then, it is believed we just take out the rebels.  It doesn't work, it hasn't ever worked, but we keep doing it.

This all makes sense when you consider that what's really going here is a proxy war between the US and it's allies and Russia (and ultimately China).  

In the case of Trump, if his foreign policy will truly be about defeating radical terrorist groups in the Middle East - it CAN actually be done - through DEALS.

He wants to make sure another terror attack doesn't happen on US soil

He wants to rebuild the black community rather than keep them dependent on welfare to guarantee they remain good little Democrats

He wasn't making fun of the reporter for being disabled, those are some of the gestures he uses when making fun of people. I've seen every Trump rally.

""Trump's 79-year-old mother was mugged in 1991, suffering broken bones and severe facial bruises. A passing truck driver who witnessed the assault brought down the mugger and handed him over to justice. (The robber was later sentenced to 3 to 9 years in prison). The Donald had dinner with the rescuer, his sister, and his son; offered the Samaritan a better job; and gave him a check for an undisclosed amount. ""

So we can't trust middle-eastern countries but we can trust the thousands of people immigrating from them? If they aren't going to help the refugees, why should we.

&gt;You clearly did not watch the entirety of the video if you believe either of those things. Watch the whole thing.

Actually i did. and Again right now for good measure. He never said it would be impossible for a terroroist to sneak in. he just walked the audience through the screening(which again, without databases from syria, is basically nothing more than asking them ""are you a terrorist?"") and after stressing how long it takes, he just said they wouldn't try because of that. Go back and watch. He literally showed multiple clips of people saying ""we don't know who they are without datatbases"" and his only response was just ""It takes too long don't worry about it"". 

&gt;Of course the majority is gonna be lone men. Countries are going to accept men in favor of women and children so they can bolster their own workforce....

Isn't the whole reason we started taking these people in the first place, ya'know, A war in syria?? Its not the same thing as mexican immigrants because there are no civil wars or airstrikes going on in Mexico. Syrian migrants should have their whole families with them. There is NO excuse for leaving your family unless you aren't coming from a war torn country, which if thats the case, you have no business seeking asylum and collecting welfare because that is meant for people who are actually running from something. I would have no problem if these people were actually refugees but the whole system has been hijacked by leeches and radicals who outnumber the actual refugees
 
btw i'd like to show you this. many 'economic' migrants come from radical islamic countries where the """"true values of islam"""" as they call them, are pretty much ingrained from birth. One could say these countries are ""brain washing"" their citizens to take everything in the quran as literally as possible. and in the quran it says that muslims should fight non-believers until islam is dominant. people from these countries are the majority of people we are letting in.
http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3240295/Imam-tells-Muslim-migrants-breed-children-Europeans-conquer-countries-vows-trample-underfoot-Allah-willing.html

&gt;""But such a fear is misguided because the process of relocating refugees to America is very different from the way that refugees currently arrive in Europe....

Once again, there is no proper vetting process without any syrian database of who these people are and any possible crimes they have committed. The main reason people started turning against the refugees is the spiraling crime rates that followed letting them into the Europe. Just look at Sweden. Its one of the most tolerant and liberal places in the world and, over the last few years has become the ""Rape Capitol of Europe"".

&gt;HURR DURR OUR LEADERS ARE INCOMPETENT BECAUSE THEY DON'T AGREE WITH MY RADICAL PHILSOPHY

actually, they're incompetent because they completely disregard the opinions of the majority of the american people
and our state governors, not just mine.
http://dailycaller.com/2015/11/18/poll-most-americans-dont-want-syrian-refugees-in-the-united-states/

&gt;Their incompetence explains the fact that we pulled out of a recession with them, and the fact that there have been no successful terrorist attacks from islamic terrorists in the past 14 years in the US.

obamas incompetent because unemployment has gone up, because gas prices have gone up, because he's never had an actual plan for ISIS, because he claimed they were ""contained"" the day before the paris attacks, because of obamacare, and because he says that he healed race relations while the country hasn't been this racially divided since the jim crow laws. oh yea, and assigning Shillary clinton to secretary of state.

I'd like to point out they found him in washington D.C. which ISIS announced they're targeting

&gt;They aren't going to take the riskiest path to get to the US

what exactly is the safer alternative? Hiding among 10,000 refugees and then landing in america where they can't legally be tracked seems pretty safe. These people think they're on a literal mission from god, they'll do whatever they have to. 

&gt;Do you think that a person would risk becoming a US soldier if they knew for a fact there was a 99% chance that they would die for nothing?

Protecting the war refugees and denying ISIS a chance to spread terror isn't a cause? They aren't even meant to pursue ISIS they'd just be guarding the safe zone. Even if ISIS did attack, do you think our soldiers would just be standing in the open with their thumbs up their ass.

Trump mocks the reporter's disability. The reporter had been commenting on Trump's previous comment of how ""Muslims were celebrating on the day of 9/11"" (which has been [debunked](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/22/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-thousands-new-jersey-ch/)) in a respectful manner, to which Trump responds by imitating his disability (a deformed arm).

It only comes across that way when you read an article.  10 years ago, that would be a problem, but now since we live in the day of the internet, you can easily find all the actual speeches those articles are referring to and see that they are really really biased.  You can actually watch the raw tape of what he said more quickly than you can read/watch their cherry picked analysis of it.  
 
Back in August I got really obsessed with trump stuff... and for about 2 weeks I watched literally every speech he made, and then would read articles about what he said.  I had never really followed politics closely before that, and it made me realize that news following politicians is basically equivalent to the news that follows celebrities and sells paper magazines in the super market.  Its basically not worth reading.  They would take a tiny thing Trump said out of context, and try and turn it into a big story.  The whole purpose of every story they write is to create some interesting tale.  They don't care about what is actually going on.  
 
For example, when trump was talk about, ""They are bringing crime, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people.""  He was referring to a policy where mexico would take illegal immigrants who committed crimes in their country (from Panama or whatever), and instead of deporting them back to their original countries, they would push them into the US (because otherwise they might try and come back to mexico).  He never said that ""all mexican immigrants were criminals.""  At worst he said that some were criminals (which is true) and more likely he said that mexico had a policy of forcing criminals to cross the border into the US so they wouldn't have to deal with them (which also might be true).  
 
In regards to the ""ableist"" thing... if you watch the tape its pretty clear that trump is just generally making fun of reporter who he thinks is a dumbass.  The fact that his arm motions just happened to match the disability of the report is a coincidence.  
 
Honestly the fact that the media is still able to convince people like you of this sort of stuff is interesting to me.  You would think with the internet and whatnot it would be harder, but I think people just like to watch stuff that reaffirms their biases.  Liberal people like to watch commentors that say trump is racist regardless of whether its true or not, and trump supporters like to read stories that talk about how trump is owning the polls because he is awesome.  
 
 
EDIT:  I'll just hit all four points since I already did 2.  Trump is pro-life and anti-gay marriage.  I think he is mostly doing this because he wants to win as a republican.  He doesn't really care about these issues.  He cares about economics and immigration.  Other things are relatively unimportant to him.  Also, the left has already won these two issues.  The supreme court has stated that all gays can be married, and all women have a right to an abortion.  So what are people even arguing about now?  These basically aren't even issues anymore.  Abortion and gay marriage are both rights that people have now.  
 
Second with the data-bases... he is basically saying there should be very close surveillance of mosques that have a reputation of being associated with terrorism.  He isn't saying all muslims need to be in database or something.  He is saying that the government should have a list of people associated with mosques associated with terror.  This also isn't a big deal.  Such a thing almost certainly exists already.  A said list doesn't even violate any constitutional rights.

4143,BoiseNTheHood,"Three huge lies from the media, and all from left-biased sources. As for \#4, he may not like gay marriage personally, but unlike the Bible-thumper crowd, he's [accepted it as the law of the land.](http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/04/politics/donald-trump-gay-marriage-kentucky-clerk-kim-davis/)",1448696913,cxfk36e

They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.""

They are smuggling drugs into our country.  They do bring crime.  The GAO states that 27% of the federal prison population is illegals, so obviously these aren't the best and brightest Mexico can offer.

http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-187

So I would say, stating facts isn't racist, it's stating facts.

Trump didn't say we should register Muslims, a reporter did and this has already been debunked.  

http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/24/donald-trumps-comments-database-american-muslims/

I don't believe Trump was mocking the reporters disability and he said he wasn't, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt on this one.

Trump said gay marriage was the law of the land.  ""You have to go with it. The decision's been made, and that is the law of the land,"" the real estate mogul said Friday on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

So it looks like most of why you dislike him is because you're ill informed, or looking at opinion pages on far left websites like the Huffington Post where it's almost guaranteed what you read is going to be biased and bullshit.  And blogs aren't a good place for fact finding, if you are truly concerned with learning about candidates, don't go looking for information on blogs and opinion pages.

If you saw the rally where he first really attacked Carson--it was historic. It was nuts. The media was literally losing their minds over it. On MSNBC the next morning they played a clip and people just started clapping. And not a single person on any panel had any idea of what would happen next. That was 3 weeks ago. That happened after someone beat him in a few polls one week. That was to someone who everyone thought he had a quiet ""gloves off"" pact with. He compared Carson to a child molester, laid waste to his infamous ""belt"" story, and called Iowans stupid.

Every single week there is a new Trump scandal. He doesn't get many ""safe"" weeks. Anything remotely positive written about him in MSM always has at least a paragraph of caveats about his racism or sexism etc. I don't think he wins despite this so much as he wins because of this. He is fighting the media and the entrenched political establishment. And I don't think his supporters would want it any other way. The new narrative is ""nothing might be too far"".

As a side note. The second amendment is to ensure the people have power over the government, not whatever most people think.

Trump was IMPERSONATING/mocking a reporter who rescinded his story after 14+ years. He was making fun of how he removed his story. The hand movements whether accidental or done knowingly had nothing to do with the message trump was trying to make and is completely irrelevant. Just another way to ignore the message in favor of an attack piece.

As far as whether or not some people celebrated in NJ/USA on 9/11: I did not witness this personally, I was at school all day. I think most people were fixated on the news the entire day. I did know someone a few years back that claimed he witnessed one family celebrating outside their house that morning. Cell phone cameras weren't a common thing yet and people didn't live to take pictures to post them online. It is common knowledge that people were celebrating in many other countries, it is unreasonable to believe people were not celebrating in the US with our diverse population. 

To believe donald trump is how you put it ""dumb"" is the ""dumbest"" argument against him there is. He intelligent enough to be immensely successful in merchandising, branding, real estate, television, politics, etc. He has the entire media and both parties (and the uninformed voter such as yourself) against him and distorting his words, yet he is still leading every poll since he announced.

For example, Time Warner is one of Hillary's largest donors. They also own media outlets [such as CNN and HBO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Warner)

&amp;nbsp;

Then there's Politifact. The one that everyone thinks just because it has 'fact' in the name, it's a reputable source.

The real fact is that [Politifact is owned by The Tampa Bay Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PolitiFact.com), a liberal newspaper who endorsed Obama in [2008](https://archive.is/zeTJ5) and [2012](https://archive.is/QecZx).

But surely Politifact can't be biased, right? I mean c'mon! It has 'fact' in it's name so it has to be reputable, right?

4459,harlows_monkeys,"[Interesting experiment](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/11/how-many-of-your-memories-are-fake/281558/): take a group of ordinary people, tell them that there is news footage of United 93 crashing in Pennsylvania on 9/11, and nearly 30% will remember seeing that. Yet, there is no such footage. If you do this with a group of people who are very good at remembering what happened each day in their past (people with ""Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory ""), 20% will remember seeing the footage.

Human memory does not work like a video or audio recorder. Every time we remember something, we fill in missing details and then add those to the memory. If someone tells us something about an event we remember, but their account differs from our memory, we tend to adjust our memories to fit in with the new information.

It's remarkably easy to create a false memory. An great example is [in this paper](https://webfiles.uci.edu/eloftus/LoftusBernsteinInHealy05.pdf). They had someone who knew the subject in elementary school recount a (made up) incident where the subject and a friend pulled a prank on their 1st or 2nd grade teacher, got caught, and had to spend a half hour in the corner facing the wall, and they showed the subject a class picture from that grade. 65% of subjects then remembered doing that prank.

Everyone who remembers seeing, in person or on TV, large numbers of people celebrating 9/11 in New Jersey (or anywhere in the US) has a false memory. There were shots on TV of some celebrations in the West Bank that were shown right around the time one of the towers came down. What you probably saw was that, and you heard the rumors of celebrations in New Jersey, and that changed your memory.

BTW, false memories are a serious issue when it comes to the criminal justice system. The very act of questioning a witness can change the memories of that witness. You have to be very careful in your questions to not suggest anything that might have happened. This is hard, and most police department do not have anyone trained to do it.",1448990519,cxjaetc

Democrats get minimal scrutiny and plenty of excuses for their lies and hypocrisy by comparison.

A lot of the so-called conservative outlets are no better. Outlets like FOX News, the National Review and RedState, and pundits like Glenn Beck, Karl Rove, Rick Wilson and George Will, predictably line up behind the decidedly *non*-conservative establishment candidates every year. Then, they scream ""he's unelectable!"" and ""he's crazy!"" (the irony of *Beck* calling anyone else crazy is rich, BTW) whenever an outsider like Ron Paul or Trump start to make noise, in an effort to discourage their supporters.

Overall, the media should be the adults in the room, providing balanced coverage of politics. If a candidate is as bad as reporters think they are, their own words and actions should be sufficient to hang themselves with. Instead, the media is full of overgrown children lobbing infantile attacks at people they don't like for the sole benefit of the establishment.

If trump did not know the condition of the reporter (was one of the hundreds of reporters trump is constantly being persued by...25 years ago), so him not knowing is a very plausible scenario. Would that still be stupid? After all, the reporter couldn't remember much about the story HE wrote, trump HAS to remember this exact reporter though... Also, people with disabilities are not immune to being mocked, they are EQUAL, he wasn't being mocked for his disability, he was being mocked for taking back the story and the media focused on an erroneous claim. The reporter acted unprofessionally by retracting the story, a story which is now being vindicated by many in the MSM. The MSM using his disability to attack trump is the real dispicable act if you ask me.

The republicans are not scared he will end up against Clinton. (In fact, he is beating Hillary in the polls, and I actually voted for her in the 08 primary). I know many people who are vehement supporters of trump who have also voted/been democrat in recent years. You are correct about the republican establishment being scared of trump. But they're scared he will win and the president will be someone who isn't controlled by them and their agenda.

The Muslim cheering thing is not rediculous. And FYI, everyone is now accepting it did happen (even the MSM) in large public numbers (private will ofc always be larger). They're still trying to downplay the numbers to ""hundreds"" instead of thousands. (keep in mind this is a time when all reporters were covering the towers, not the surrounding residential towns). I don't think anyone ever said the majority of Muslims celebrated, just as no one is saying, for example, the majority of gun owners misuse their weapons yet the propaganda on that is so overwhelming..... I guess regulating firearms can be compared to monitoring certain places? (Just putting it out there, I won't argue for or against it).

Guns wouldn't have been permitted in the theatre anyway so arguing about that scenario is a little useless. But if people in there did have guns, the potential existed for an alternative ending. I am not saying France needs to allow citizens to own guns, I am just saying a scenario in which both sides have guns is a vastly different scenario than one side having guns. I personally agree with the intention of the second amendment which is to maintain the peoples power over the government (not to defend ones self against murders, it's just ad added benefit). As you saw in France, people do find access to guns/grenades, the argument can easily be made that gun restriction restricts law abiding citizens but not those with criminal intent.

Yes we have more gun violence and any crime that results in loss of life is tragic. We do however have a very low stabbing rate compared to other countries for whatever that's worth. I don't think anyone likes how high gun violence is, but if it wasn't gun violence it would be some other type of violence. I don't believe in restricting peoples rights ( gun access/privacy/ etc) so it's a very difficult situation that doesn't have a real solution.

Oh also, I think a very large percentage, if not a majority of Muslims view sharia law as above the constitution. Sharia law is largely contradictory to the constitution. Take from that what you will.

Yeah he just very, very coincidentally randomly decided to throw some spastic moves in there. Because, you know, as you do, it's a political debate after all...... He clearly knew. That was very unprofessional of him.

&gt; I am just saying a scenario in which both sides have guns is a vastly different scenario than one side having guns.

For that to happen citizens would need to be given access to guns, and if you do that, it'll just mean even more extremists will find access to guns as well. Arming civilians ""because criminals have weapons anyway"" just means more guns everywhere; which means even more deaths. America's unfortunate statistics confirm this. There's a reason why the rest of the world thinks America's gun laws aren't a good idea. Because nobody in the world knows the answer to America's gun problems now.

&gt;Yes we have more gun violence and any crime that results in loss of life is tragic. We do however have a very low stabbing rate compared to other countries for whatever that's worth.

That's because guns are everywhere, and what criminal want's to bring a knife to a gunfight. Overall homicides are astronomical in the US. It doesn't matter if less of them are done by knives. Europe has religious extremist, you guys have too much guns.

Trump creating a general mistrust against muslims in America, because of his claims and all, that's a very dangerous situation. It's a perfect breeding ground for extremism ! You seem to think that most muslims follow sharia law, and they'll choose it before the law of the place they live in... There's **lot's** of muslims here, and in all my life, I've never ever met one that follows sharia law. NONE. They also go to watch the soccer games in big stadiums, go to the shops, restaurants, hospitals, and not feel fully safe anymore. They also fully hate terrorists.  It just takes a few bad apples to indoctrinate some easy victims, people who live outside of society, and convince them to ""go jihad everywhere"". If Trump does his muslim registration ideas and so on, it will polarize society, which is fertile ground for extremism. That's what terrorists WANT to happen. They **absolutely need** normal muslims in America to be hated by the public in order to get people to go jihad and blow themselves up. The extremists feed on hate, they want nothing more.

Polarisation is how we got hate fueled extremists in Europe, and that's particularly dangerous in a place where guns are everywhere ! **Be warned** Don't make the same mistake as us on that !",1449021573,cxjvz54

&gt;**Urban myth**

&gt;We conducted an exhaustive search of newspaper and television transcripts on LexisNexis, looking for reports from September 2001 through December 2001 that made any mention of Muslims in New Jersey celebrating the 9/11 attacks.

http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/12/01/christie-counters-trump-story-muslims-cheering-911-attacks-says-it-didnt-happen.html

http://www.businessinsider.com/donald-trump-911-cheering-fact-check-2015-11

&gt;Despite Trump's insistence that he saw such celebrations, political fact-checkers across the board have found little to no evidence of any public celebrations after the attacks.",1449033109,cxk2s7q
4586,PvPol,"You sound very uninformed about the whole scenario. Let me sum some things up you may not know.

-many people have mistrusted Muslims since 9/11. Trump is not creating the environment, he is using it to his benefit. 

-his ""claims"" are best described as ""facts"", he hasn't said anything that is untrue regarding Muslims.

-you said ""trump does his muslim registration"". This registration was suggested by a reporter (NOT TRUMP). Trump then didn't answer the question in a typical political fashion and moved onto talking about a border wall. Many news companies then misquoted trump and attributed it to being something he thought of and supports. CNN event edited out when trump redirected the question to the wall, so it looked as if trump was very in favor the reporters registration idea. (If you get your info from the news about trump, you will most likely be wrong about what he supports/said as all they have been trying to do is bring him down)

- I never said most Muslims follow sharia law, I said many of them (not very few of them) believe it is greater than the constitution. That is not to say they do not follow the laws, but they feel the laws are beneath sharia despite following our laws. 

-it wasn't a political debate, it was a private rally.

-trumps arm movements may have purposely been to mimic the disability, which is fine. He was mocking the comments and the man as a whole, not the disability. No one knew who the reporter was before this happened. No one would have gotten the reference (if that is what it was), but the media ignored what trump said, and attacked trump on some irrelevant/imaginary detail.

-trump has mocked quite a few people who oppose him politically and yes, he makes obscure gestures in the process. So it wasn't super coincidental and it definitely was not random.

- I said our stabbing rates were lower. This wasn't to reflect knives in a gunfight in the US, it was to reflect that elsewhere people are still committing the crimes, just using a different and inefficient means. 

-access to guns relates back to the people having power over the government. The framers of the constitution specifically wanted us to have guns so we would not be like the European countries, powerless against an unjust government. I don't see why the infinitely small percentage of guns owners makes (in your view) access to guns an atrocity, but likewise, the small percentage of Muslims who are extremists does not constitute some skepticism. You can't use an argument in favor of gun control and then dismiss that same argument for Muslims.

-homocides are intricately imtertwined with socioeconomic factors, culture, etc. comparing only homocides rates without the associated factors is meaningless ( I hope you have taken some stats classes and understand that because I really don't want to explain why that is)

-I'm not sure if you remember this but about a year ago some wacko killed people in a black church. This individual had some attachment to the confederate flag. What happened is that the confederate flag basically became taboo and was removed from gov buildings, stores, etc. This was one person who basically destroyed the use of a meaningful flag. The outcry wasn't to support people who wanted the flags use to continue, the outcry was against anyone who would dare condone the use of the flag. The point is, everyone else suffers for belonging to a group when a minority of that group causes problems. Muslims should not be immune from that just because we are scared they may become extremists... Your argument was basically we need to fear the good ones because they may turn bad. You are an example of the ""dangerous situation"" that you just argued against.

- the radical muslim situation is tricky because they are committing acts not only in the name of their religion, but also in accordance with their religion. It's not like they are in fighting for Islam while going against the writings in the Koran. Maybe Muslims should rewrite their scripture to remove the passages which inspire extremism and instead promote peace.

After all, look how many different branches of Christianity their are. When they disagreed with something, the split and formed a new religion.

But please do not trust anything that is said about trump on the news, every news story I see about him is twisted like mad. 

(Btw I think trump may have known about the disability, but he wasn't insulting/mocking him for his disability. That's like mocking Carson for speaking like he is on the verge of passing out...which he has, but that is ok because it's not considered a disability today. It's just a quality of these people). I've been short my entire life, its how I was born, I can't change it. I am less able because of my height in many aspects of life. If someone mentions my height while mocking something I did, so be it. Even if they just straight up mock my height, that is still considered perfectly ok. Just because being short isn't considered a disability today (and I say today because what we consider a disability is dynamic) doesn't mean it isn't one, but I can be mocked for it. I'm not saying being short is the same as the reporters disability, I'm saying people need to stop being so offended all the time, we are a nation of victims and it's ruining us. This guy wasn't even being mocked for his disability but that's what all the stories were about, give me a break.

IMO, the most interesting point for those following Trump on his talk on terrorism is he's riling up conservatives but then subtly sprinkling ""dove"" talking points.

He's called terrorists gangsters. Says without money they'd stop fighting. Suicide bombers don't want to die. He's been emphasizing that these people are incentivised by more than their religion. [Organizations pay these guys' families after an attack.](http://dailysignal.com/2014/08/21/paycheck-terrorism-5300-suicide-attack/)

He also recently started floating a [""smart wars"" are ""cheaper""](https://youtu.be/kmPqV41bfC0?t=27m10s) line at his recent rallies. Could see this turn into a ""we don't need to throw more money at the military, just be smarter with them, we're the best"" or something similar.

So whats the difference between them closing a factory here and laying off a thousand people so they can move to a third world country and employ cheap labor, or importing a thousand cheap workers here and still laying people off?

Only an idiot with a serious case of cognitive dissonance like you believes there is any real difference involved here.

And you are the one who is going to have to pay. 

You are the one who will see his taxes raised and his six figure paycheck become meaningless when the government tries to pay for things like the increase in welfare which will follow.....the increase in Medicaid and Medicare which will follow....the increase in crime which will follow......the increase in insurance premiums which will follow because  there will still be illegal immigrant using the emergency room for healthcare even though they have no insurance.

You have exhibited no intelligence in this whole matter because your argument has been based on what you see right in front of you, not how one thing is connected to another and what the eventual outcome is.

Furthermore,  hundreds of eyewitnesses including prominent figures have confirmed many different instances of people celebrating, with each instance having many people.  Furthermore,  public celebrations are less prevalent than private celebrations so many many more likely celebrated but in private. 

Also.  Why do people need video to believe anything... I guess all of history didn't exist because there is no video or proof.

4816,Feel_The_Trump,"Most people don't think past ""Dumb racist blowhard who is just riling up an angry racist base. And this year they're *really* angry"". And if they read reddit, go on facebook, or watch MSM that would be how you would feel too. At least that's where you would start. In July I thought this campaign was performance art. I couldn't figure out any other reason that made sense.

Once you entertain the idea that *maybe* Trump knows how to play the game or knows what he is doing, that he knows when he says certain things they generate predictable headlines, then you admit it's more than just ""dumb racist luck"". If you admit this much, then the news stories that have been playing out lately almost feel like controlled demolition. 

Here's our 2 most recent examples:

1) ""Bush did not keep us safe"". Bush handling 9/11 is a GOP sacred cow. Jeb had hitched himself firmly to it. Nobody gets away with this. Bush's approval rating was historic after 9/11. Our country was more united than it had been in decades. Then an article comes out, from Buzz Feed of all places, that Trump wrote about Bin Laden a year before 9/11 and predicted a huge terrorist attack. I'm still surprised people aren't talking about that. Jeb! has not recovered. Just a lucky blowhard?

2) Trump says ""thousands and thousands"" of Muslims celebrated on 9/11. Media immediately got all of their fact checkers to say ""absolutely not, people did not celebrate, we can't find any record of this"". That could not have happened. This is inciting hatred. Sort of a bold stance to take, especially since this story started a week after the Allahu Akbar chants during the moment of silence at a football game after the Paris attacks. Then new stories come out every day saying they did celebrate, oh and Rudy Guiliani agrees some celebration happened, oh and we found some MTV footage saying that, oh and we found some CBS footage saying that. But now it's ""he lied about thousands on TV"". Ok, wrong facts, right narrative. That doesn't hurt Trump, that helps him. Just a lucky blowhard?

If you're intrigued, you'll probably come around. If you're offended then you'll continue to let our MSM outrage outlets do your thinking for you. And hearing about Trump probably makes you cringe. You not only don't enjoy it, you probably hate it. Really you're missing out on all the entertainment of Trump steamrolling the media and entrenched political interests.",1449167895,cxlxclo

Secondly.  I don't expect video from most things in 2001. Let alone on 9/11 when everyone was glued to the TV and Al the cameras were pointed at the tower. 

The thing is.  You are arguing about numbers and ignoring the point.  

But if you want to talk about numbers and require a video than fine. The video of news reports saying people were swarming roofs to celebrate yet not having a video of the actual celebration. Did the celebration exist? 

In my town,  thousands were celebrating (they basically made a parade of it)  when Canada won the Olympic gold in hockey (a time when people DID have cell phone cameras), but I have yet to see a recording of it even though I have asked around for years now and it's a small town. 

Proof exists people were celebrating,  the proof is at least in the hundreds. This was when people were more focused on being with their family.

I even saw a flapping head bush supporter claim that it was cheap of Trump because with all of his money HE should just give the money to wounded warriors and then she implied that he hasn't given them anything of his own. 

As to the first stories, I saw this speech through a live feed.  He did not proclaim that he would not attend the debate unless.. 

What he did was he asked the audience if he should tell them that if they didn't donate money he would not attend.  Because the ratings and therefore the amount they can charge for ads are so much higher demonstrably due to his attendance.  

The crowd did not give a supportive cheer.. they seemed to want him to attend the debate.  They want to see Trump I guess.

He said in the same speech that if he did it they would call him chicken and other names.   And that maybe he ought to do it.

There was no clear indication that he had made a decision on that but he was really asking the crowd whether he should do it or not.

so he hasn't done it yet if he had there would be a tweet of the letter he sent cnn.  

On the donation of money to wounded warrior,  Trump is on the board and has given a great deal of money to that organization.   So it isn't about him giving money, he is trying to raise money from someone who is going to make a lot of money for a charity he is associated and cares about. 

The media is so dishonest and I can't help but think that it is by design.  What they leave out or include in stories and even putting forward stories like this which are totally false and then just building a whole public narrative around it.

Cnn should give the money they make above costs to charity.  Why should they profit off of performing a public function - it shouldn't be about ratings or ad dollars or trying to get attention for your moderators so maybe more than 3 people will start watching their nightly show.

And everyone entering the legal field is required to learn about logical reasoning and analytical reasoning.

He said he witnessed a huge amount of people celebrating.  There is evidence for at least hundreds of people celebrating.  I hope you do not think we will have evidence of the majority of groups celebrating especially in that area.  There is also the psychology of the act of celebrating openly.  It has to do with acceptance by the surroundings. 

All branches of thoughts lead to one conclusion. Too many people in NJ (let alone the rest of the us/world) over 9/11. If trump did knowingly over emphasize the amount it could have easily been imtentional. He's been controlling the political topics since he announced,  it's good for his campaign. 

I personally thought the fact people celebrated in the US on 9/11 was common knowledge so I didn't think he had any reason to mention it.  But I guess people didn't know.  

I don't understand why people are still fighting about it. They claimed it never happened despite the story being circulated post 9/11 that it did.  Then when the proof started surfacing people are arguing over numbers.  Meanwhile trump continues to get publicity which means others do not. 

Many people who hate trump don't know his policies. The more publicity he gets,  the more interested people become in him.

He only gains by having the people who don't support him pay more attention to him and his policies as they may support him once they find out.

This was actually a rare occurrence at my school since the students there aren't very politically active right now. (probably since the election is so far away) Unfortunately, since my school is dead in the middle of suburbia in a liberal city, I can only assume most are Bernie supporters.

But then again you simply cannot underestimate Trump; even right now I have seen polls for him showing support from a healthy spectrum of demographics, including the youth vote. As the generation of the Information Age I'm sure there are others who are smart enough like me to read between the lines of the MSM.
Also while the Dem's have a strong hold on the youth vote, that demographic is almost exclusively held by Bernie Sanders.

Really? Sure your dream's not about to come crashing down?

Let's review here......

You live in Tenn.....

You work on hospital equipment.....

You mentioned Springfield as a place you will be tomorrow for work.....

You swing with you wife.....

You have no problem pissing people off over the internet.....

I wonder how that hospital right down the street from the Walmart Super Center we are suppose to meet (and I say ""suppose"" because I doubt you will even show your face in the open)....I wonder how they would feel about me sending them the screen shots of our conversation I have saved and pointing out that you have given out enough information to be potentially bringing a pissed off person onto their property to have a confrontation with one of the vendors they use to service their machines?

Which vendor?

Oh yeah, the one who works on x-ray machines and has one technician out because of heart problems.

Do you think they will feel you are a very smart and wise person?

Do you think your company will think you are watching out for their best interests?

Do you want me to go ahead and contact them with this point, just to find out what they will do?

See......once again you only have the intelligence to see what's in front of you instead of how one thing affects another down the road.

So you have a couple of options.....

You can show tomorrow around one and hope you don't piss me off too much.(And btw......when I replied to you it was passed the time to be able to schedule a one pm meeting in that first town you mentioned. But an intelligent man would have known that from the start).

Or you can rethink your life and the values you think you have, and apologize to the next homeless veteran you see for believing his life and future don't have as much value or deserves as much protection from being sold to the lowest bidder just so ridiculous fks like you can feel they are morally superior to others.

Yep. 

&gt;I wonder how that hospital right down the street from the Walmart Super Center we are suppose to meet (and I say ""suppose"" because I doubt you will even show your face in the open)....I wonder how they would feel about me sending them the screen shots of our conversation I have saved and pointing out that you have given out enough information to be potentially bringing a pissed off person onto their property to have a confrontation with one of the vendors they use to service their machines?


Keep wondering how ""the hospital"" is going to deal with a pissed off person looking for a service engineer and trying to dox him. They might admit you for observation. 

&gt;Which vendor?

Do you realize how many xray machines/vendor systems are in Springfield? 

&gt;Oh yeah, the one who works on x-ray machines and has one technician out because of heart problems.

Are you looking for a C arm? A cath lab? Dental? General xray? Urology? Mammography? Maybe I am working on some hemodynamics equipment, loading a server in a data center. Maybe a little PACS action playing with the HIS/RIS. 

Good luck. 

&gt;Do you think they will feel you are a very smart and wise person?

They won't know because you:

A: aren't going to question all the facilities in Springfield about service personnel 

B: find the right facility and/or department. 

C: talk to the people who know the health status of service engineers, because they don't. 

&gt;Do you think your company will think you are watching out for their best interests?

&gt;Do you want me to go ahead and contact them with this point, just to find out what they will do?

Please do. 

&gt;See......once again you only have the intelligence to see what's in front of you instead of how one thing affects another down the road.

No, you have not analyzed the situation fully or have any clue what you are looking for other than the word xray. I have given you just enough information to make you want to take me down, and you think you are close.. But nay. You are way off. Would love to see you wandering the streets of Springfield, popping into hospitals, chiropractors, and pain clinics, trying to get info on service engineers.

&gt;So you have a couple of options.....

&gt;You can show tomorrow around one and hope you don't piss me off too much.(And btw......when I replied to you it was passed the time to be able to schedule a one pm meeting in that first town you mentioned. But an intelligent man would have known that from the start).


""I'll be waiting there from 1pm on."" implying that you have nothing better to do (like work) and shall be waiting from 1.pm.on.

Details.. You think I am on the schedule of Joe blow ain'tgottaworkat1? No, you will wait like a good dog.


&gt;Or you can rethink your life and the values you think you have, and apologize to the next homeless veteran you see for believing his life and future don't have as much value or deserves as much protection from being sold to the lowest bidder just so ridiculous fks like you can feel they are morally superior to others. 

You don't get it. You really don't. It isn't veterans, it's you. I could explain it again, but I am still at work..

5012,MuffinMopper,"I just didn't think any of Nate Silver's arguments were that great.  He basically said that people like trump had not done well in the past, so trump wouldn't do well.  Except that trump is really riding something that other candidates haven't.  Its not that hes an outsider, or a rich guy, or a alpha male, or whatever.  Its that hes a media god.  He plays media like a asian kid plays the cello.  
 
Also he just does a lot of stuff that traditional candidates have not done, but that has proven effective:
 
* Making use of scape goats.  Mostly illegal immigrants, the media, and muslims.  Scapegoats are a really useful political tool that is widely popular in the 3rd world, but republicans seem to not use it effectively in the USA.  The dems do a bit by scapegoating the rich.  
* Constantly keeping himself on the front page.  Its almost as if trump says offensive stuff to purposely keep himself in the limelight...
* An inextinguishable exhaust tank.  He has been doing like 2 10k person rallies every day for 3 months.  Not to mention a bunch of interviews and other stuff.  He just never gets tired like other candidates do.  
* A die hard fan base.  No one else has this.
* Really wide name recognition.  He is like as well known as the pope or kim kardashian.  He is known in different circles.  I bet that 95% of US adults have heard of him.  Rubio is probably more like 55%.  ",1449218943,cxmr7ad

I'm just going to email them with a freshly created account and send them the screen shots along with the info.

They will do the detective work for me.

You think you are hidden from me but you are not hidden from them.

They know what service people come in on what days, and they all don't show up at once. So how hard would it be for their HR to track down who it might be through the companies they contract out to?

Hospitals are the first place (and probably the only place I need to start) because its a good bet the kind on equipment you claim to work on is only found there.

Add to the fact that I simply have to mention this person (who has given out where he can be found) worked in Cookeville the day before and I bet they will be able to put two and two together.

All I needed was the word ""xray"" because all I am going to do is email the hospital in Springfield the screen shots of our conversation and point out to them that it might not be in their best interest to be using a company whose ""service technicians"" give out information as to where they can be found, to people they are having an argument with over the internet.

If it's not the main hospital, then you don't have any worries do you?

Or do you?

Don't you think I can email every hospital in the state of Tennessee and let them know about a ""service technician"" who works for one of their vendors (you know the one where "".... the only other guy capable of doing my job within hundreds of miles) being out for heart surgery...."") and ask them about the wisdom of having such a person creating the potential for a scene to happen on their premises?

Will they want to continue with you or your company?

Seriously, you want to say that there are plenty of companies where you can be employed but then that also means there are plenty of other companies they can use. 

Perhaps one where the technician isn't getting in arguments with people over the internet and then allowing himself to be tracked to their property?

This statement of yours applies to all veterans....not just me. Homeless veterans who need a simple job held by an illegal immigrant or a skilled construction job are in the same boat I was in. Your words have cursed them also for being in the same situation I was in. So don't try to pretend this is just about me.

You feel any veteran who gets out of the service and has to compete with illegal immigrants for work is not worth your consideration.

There should be no reason any American has to forgo an honest blue collar job like carpentry, or drywall, or painting simply because people like you think it's ok to bring in foreigners to work these jobs.

This is about all capable service members, who feel they are owed something instead of trying. You aren't homeless, had 30 years to build a business, become the boss, and hire the cheap labor (at the very least) or homeless veterans and you didn't .

He runs a multi-billion dollar international hospitality company, he was asked by the Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to appear in his election commercial. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tm5Je73bYOY

Putin loves him: http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/putin-loves-donald-trump/article/2574339

So your perception of his international favorability is pretty out of wack... They're aware he isn't a donor puppet, a public face for dark money in politics. Wouldn't they want to deal with a real person? I think so. 

&gt;I'm also unsure about how realistic his proposals on immigration would be- again, regardless of whether or not I agree with them.

Honestly, what's not realistic is doing nothing about it. He projects strength, people are tired of the himming and hawing over this issue, if he takes the most extreme position he'll fill news cycles and be able to bargain down his position to actually see something accomplished. But at least you know he stands on the side of doing something about the problem, not just rolling over and allow millions to drain public resources, not pay taxes, dilute the unskilled labor market, driving down wages, drive without licenses, catch and release criminals into society.. All for cheap labour to appease corporate interests. ""Act of love"" sure....

&gt;Moreover, I don't understand the appeal of his ""self-made"" persona given his privileged upbringing.

Trump is a branding master, this is why he is famous, he built fame. His father taught him the ropes of real estate, but Donald knew how to get his name out there, and clearly it's paid off. If he just sat around sucking his parents teets no one would give a shit about him, but undeniably the reason people are interested in him isn't because of his father. 

&gt; I worry that, while he claims to serve the interest of working-class Americans, he may not understand what the real world is like for many of us.

And the corporate puppets are going represent you better how? He's provided jobs for 10's of thousands of people over his career. If he didn't treat his people with respect you would hear about it by now. In fact, when one of his contractors told him that they had made a really poor investment with their workers pension fund, Trump offered to help and made them whole.

He is not beholden to foreign or corporatist bribery like every other candidate is. These politicians have never worked an honest day in their lives. They've never produced anything of value. So how did they get their millions to run over and over again?

His response was very practical. He said that you can't go into negotiations and shove it down their throats; you need to do it nicely so that everyone's happy. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsfVHB3-FB0 around 24:40

A political outsider is a terrible thing in politics. Just look what happened with Jimmy Carter, who couldn't get anything done due to his idealism. But Trump is no outsider. He's been part of the game for 10s of years now. He understands the system and he knows compromise.

&gt;He tends to speak as if he could act unilaterally

Well, the running politicians all say they can enact whatever so and so as if Congress doesn't exist. That's why they go on and on about 'plans'.

But here's the thing. Obama can't negotiate when Putin steps on our toes, and most candidates besides Trump have taken positions where they would try to harass Putin with no-fly zones (how well has shooting down the Russian jet gone for turkey so far) and by not talking to him. We need someone who can go to Putin and say ""Look, this is what we as Americans want and we don't want to fight you guys so let's sit down at this table and meet in the middle and become friendly."" We don't need another cold war. Trump realizes Putin is not an American and is not obligated to do things in our interests. And so he will do those things.

5266,OnlyFactsMatter,"&gt; Wouldn't your support of Trump make you bias against politifact?

Yes, but I don't own a ""fact checking"" website after all.

You can see a huge example of their bias in this [Forbes article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/12/27/in-2008-politifacts-2013-lie-of-the-year-that-you-could-keep-your-health-plan-under-obamacare-it-rated-true/). In 2008, they stated Obama's ""you can keep your healthcare plan"" was True. Then in 2012 they stated it was only half true. By 2013 they finally admitted it was a pants on fire lie and rewarded him the Lie of the Year award. One problem - the Tampa Bay Times already won a Pulitzer prize for peddling the ""you can keep your healthcare plan"" bullshit lie. They won a Pulitzer prize for backing up a lie. How can you say it's not biased?

Another huge example of their bias are Hillary's TPP statements. During the debate, Hillary said she said in 2012 that she ""hoped the TPP would set the gold standard for trade deals."" [Politifact rated this statement as ""half-true.""](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/13/hillary-clinton/what-hillary-clinton-really-said-about-tpp-and-gol/)

However, this was a bald faced lie by Hillary Clinton. Her 2012 statement was this: ""This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free...""

She literally said it set the gold standard. She didn't say she ""hoped"" it did. She flip flopped HARD on the TPP - she made 40+ statements being pro-TPP, then out of nowhere comes out against it once it's unpopular. Then to hide the fact she was pro-TPP, she tries to lie and says she only ""hoped"" it would be a good bill.

Then Politifact marks this obvious lie as ""half-true.""

Now do you see how they are biased?",1449359168,cxojgon
5267,TRUMPTRUMPTRUMPTRUMP,"Here's the thing. You're reading the news like checkers. ""It's true or not true."" ""Someone is right in a claim or a pants on fire liar"". The truth is a bit more complicated.  It's more like chess. 

It isn't so much that media outlets make things up or are factually incorrect, it's that they *narrative* build. **The narrative** is basically the sum collective of how the media covers a thing to get desired result. O'Reilly calls it spin, Rush calls it the drive by media, you'll hear it called **the narrative** on the internet. It is how certain things are given more or less weight in stories to produce a feeling on an issue.


And politifact is a special tool to help build the narrative of Trump as a total liar. With totally stupid ""debunks"" like this. http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/donald-trump/trump-illegal-immigration-wasnt-anyones-mind-he-en/ 

Sorry,  but Trump is the guy that really brought it to the forefront. They seem to cover him harder.  


To their credit, Trump's communication style is very off the cuff and informal. No one views it as pants as fire so much as Trump has the right idea about an issue even if he's off.

His biggest argument that I've read is that Trump isn't actually that well-liked by the Republican Party. Historically speaking, polls this early in the race are terrible predictors of the nominee. Better predictors put him lower. For example, going by favorability ratings, Trump is the 13^th most popular candidate. The biggest predictor of success in the nominations is the Endorsement Primary, and Trump comes dead last in that.

&gt;...hes a media god. He plays media like a asian kid plays the cello.

I don't think I've heard that stereotype before. Anyway, this is part of Nate Silver's argument. There's [almost a direct correlation (0.92) between media attention and poll ratings](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/silver-datalab-moartrump-1.png?w=610&amp;h=543). When the actual nominations get closer, the media attention between the remaining candidates will be much closer to equal, getting rid of Trump's advantage. While Trump has by far the biggest name recognition now, that will undoubtedly change as candidates drop out and disappear from relevance. The party will consolidate around a couple of candidates, meaning that the non-Trump media attention won't be spread nearly as thin.",1449374825,cxos2u4

5302,abstruseAbacist,"I'm pretty sure you can't actually diagnose someone with autism by reading articles they wrote, even if you *really* disagree with them.

&gt;...is driving insurgent candidates popularity.

Nate has argued that Donald Trump isn't actually all that popular. The usual polls don't tell the full story; the poll-taker only selects the candidate they like best, and with Trump's monopolization of the media coverage on the race, he is by far the most well-known candidate. If people are given 14 names they've never heard of before and the name of a guy who says he's going to make america great again, who will they pick? This explains why these polls aren't very good at predicting the results of the nomination this early.

A better way to measure a candidate's chances is with favorability ratings. The person being polled can either say they have a favorable opinion, an unfavorable opinion, or neither. This way, a person's 2^nd through 15^th choices aren't treated equally in the data. In these more reliable polls, Trump stands out as having [by far the worst net favorability ratings](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/enten-datalab-trumphated.png?w=610&amp;h=474) (positive ratings minus negative ratings). Right now, all the people who really don't like Trump--of which there are way more of than there are for any other candidate--are divided among a dozen people. When the nomination gets closer, the party will consolidate around a single candidate, and the anti-Trump voters will all back the same person (for the most part).

TL;DR: According to the data, Trump's popularity is an illusion that will disappear when it comes time to vote.",1449375793,cxosk7u
5303,abstruseAbacist,"FiveThirtyEight's position since Trump entered the race was was that sooner or later, his campaign will fail. They said that they didn't know if it will happen tomorrow or months after the Iowa caucuses, but it will happen, and he won't come close to winning the election. We don't know if they will turn out right, and we certainly can't yet say their Trump predictions have been either accurate or inaccurate.

FiveThirtyEight's way of doing things is to use math, data, and history to predict political outcomes as opposed to vague notions of ""momentum"" or ""walls"" that most other talking heads use. Since 538 uses statistics and not feelings, their success rate is very high (last election, Silver predicted the outcome of every state correctly), especially when compared to everyone else's. Point is, you and Nate Silver agree on something: most of the claims made by political pundits are bullshit.

Nate Silver's track record is extremely good. For example, in 2012, he predicted the outcomes of every state correctly. I don't think you can attribute this to him being a ""fake liberal media star."" I suggest that you consider the possibility that his success over non-statisticians has something to do with the fact that his modus operandi when analyzing politics (and sports) is to use math and historical data instead of feelings and opinions.

He is a master of the dozens and verbally crushes all his opponents.  I would almost argue that when the race gets down to less candidates it will benefit him more, because he can focus all his attacks on 1 or 2 people.  First he targeted the media generally, now when the media attacks him people don't really care.  Then he targeted bush, bush went down.

Polls this early in the race *do not predict* who will win the nomination. Part of this is because the polls don't tell the full story. Something that gives a more complete picture and is better at predicting the outcome of political races is [net favorability ratings, in which Trump comes 13^th](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/silver-feature-trumpnew-table.png?w=610&amp;h=596).

5379,SKYB0RN,"For your concerns on the wall being impractical I, as a trumpeter, will stumpsplian it to you.

First off when trump says ""Build the wall!"" While he is implying that, yes, he plans on building a wall, he is also saying to his audience ""Hey! We are a country! We have laws! We have an identity and we must protect that!"" This message resonates so loudly because many Americans few blindsided/discriminated by these ""multicultural"" policies. A country of every identity can lose its identity, while a country of every idea can have great innovations. 
Now for my reasons as why I support Trump's immigration policy.

Common points made by people against Trump's immigration plan:

-The wall is very expensive and could very likely fail. 
These points are true but I am not as worried about the wall with Trump as much as I would with any other candidate because trump has a very successful record of building good buildings. The money would be the only real obstacle for Donald. Overall the wall is likely to succeed under Donald.

-Do we even need a wall? It's not like it's even going to work.
We have a million-sized problem of illegal immigration. We need the wall. As for if it will work: 
Israel has terrorist problem, builds wall, now best thing terrorists can do is lob flimsy ass rockets over that wall. Apply this method to the US and you will see similar success.

-But these undocumented workers are just trying to make a living and businesses would collapse without them. They are good for America!
Okay, yes they are just trying to make a living but so are, you know, actual Americans? Do you think it's fair for these people to take up our economies job slots because they're ""just trying to make a living""?
Arguing that we need illegals to keep our businesses from collapsing is hogwash. Their are millions of unemployed Americans who could easily take up the mantle. These immigrants work for slave-wages. Slave-wages, oh wait weren't the Democrats for that stuff a few decades ago? Surprise, surprise. And if you are a dinosanders who wants to raise the minimum wage to $15 or so tell me, how the FUCK are you going to do that effectively with an open border policy?! Illegal immigration has been a bane to anyone who is a blue collar American. That is why so many blue collar blacks and American Hispanics are for Trump, because they realize what the problem is.

-You can't deport over 12 million people. Trump's policies and tone is completely nazi-esk!
Trump is not calling for illegals to put into internment camps. In fact he wants to flush illegals out of our prison systems because he sees them as a burden. 
As for deportation of 12 million. I'll agree that this to me is by far the most challenging thing that Trump claims to do. The most realistic way trump can do this is by self deportation. By cracking down on business that use illegals he would create an environment where illegals could not make a living, and would self deport to other countries which offer prosperity. (Look out Canada you might get Spanish as your third official language! XD)
And of course there will be those who just refuse to leave. These people could range from a stubborn family to a hardened criminal. Either way they need to go out and then get in legally. If they are the family then ya sure make em Americans, if they are the criminal then no. The problem today is we treat both the families and the criminals as ""undocumented workers"" when in reality they are very different and should be sorted in an organized manner.

TL;DR: trump could totally build the wall with the pros out weighing the costs and deportation could be tricky but is possible and would be very beneficial to blue collar workers.

5385,abstruseAbacist,"For the first one: You're right, he was wrong in that election. Nobody is correct all of the time, and I'm not saying Nate Silver is an exception. He is almost always right, though. It not impossible that Silver is wrong about Trump, it's just pretty unlikely.

For the second: We're not talking about teacher evaluation, we're talking about predicting political outcomes.

Onto the third:

&gt;The basic premise behind Silver’s argument is that, despite months of polling data strongly suggesting otherwise, Trump doesn’t “own” his 20-35% of the GOP electorate and that, even if he does, this won’t be enough for him to be the definitive factor in the race.

Trump's ""20-35% of the GOP electorate"" is essentially meaningless. If you look at past presidential elections, you'll find that these early polls do not successfully predict the outcome of the election. Any argument based on Trump's poll numbers is flawed.

&gt; Trump’s support...has withstood numerous episodes which would have easily knocked a normal Republican totally out of the race.

Not really. [Here](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/silver-datalab-moartrump-2.png?w=610&amp;h=397) are a bunch of Trump-like candidates who held on to their support to Iowa and beyond, yet came nowhere close to winning the nomination. Trump isn't an entirely new type of politician; he's just like these candidates, except he's more extreme. 

&gt; One of the reasons that so-called “experts” like Frank Luntz were so wrong when they dug Trump’s grave after the first debate is they don’t understand why he is different.

We're not talking about Frank Luntz right now, we're talking about Silver. Anyway, as the chart above shows, Trump isn't actually all that different. Like the extremist candidates before him, even if his apparent support lasts a long time--even if he preforms very well in the early caucuses--he won't come close to the nomination. Again: *Trump isn't fundamentally different.* 

&gt;His supporters are not going to suddenly turn on him 

Silver isn't saying they will. In fact, he suspects that bad media coverage actually improves Trump's poll numbers. What he is saying is that [Trump's support isn't nearly as large as it seems(https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/silver-feature-trumpnew-table.png?w=610&amp;h=596).

&gt;The record television ratings of the debates and of his individual appearances, along with his extraordinary crowds throughout the country, show that this is not a situation remotely analogous to past GOP frontrunners who have faded fast once the actual voting began. Because there is, for better or worse, no one else anything like him.

See my previous two responses.

&gt; An outcome may seem unlikely in the abstract, but there must be something viable with which to replace it for that original result to not happen.

It's hard to say who Trump's ""replacement"" will be because most of the endorsements in the [endorsement primary](http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-endorsement-primary/) (the best predictor of the result of the nominations) haven't been acquired. However, we can make some informed guesses. According to 538, Bush's endorsements have all but dried up, so his lead is probably only nominal. It looks like [Rubio](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/bycoffe-datalab-rubio.png?w=610&amp;h=610) is on his way to gaining the party's support, so that's their current best guess. However, they also think that Cruz has a shot. The point is this: Contrary to the article, there are plenty of viable options for the Republican nominee is we count Trump out, but it's too early to tell exactly who that candidate will be.

&gt;the only logical scenario where Trump fades out as Silver suggests that he will is if his aura of invincibility and reputation as a “winner” are shattered by a clear loss in Iowa.

Iowa is certainly one of the possible pitfalls for Trump, but if he makes it past successfully, [he'll still have three more stages to get past](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/donald-trumps-six-stages-of-doom/). As I showed multiple times above, there have been many Trumpish candidates in the past who preformed well or even won Iowa and New Hampshire. Again, there is no reason to think Trump will be an exception.

&gt; Even if Trump doesn’t win the nomination, barring a horrible performance in Iowa, his influence on the primary process is virtually assured to be both dramatic and catastrophic. 

Silver isn't saying that Trump won't have an effect on the race. Trump's apparent success could easily persuade candidates to adjust their platforms to try and catch some Trump supporters. All Silver is saying is that Trump will not come close to winning the GOP nomination.

(I think I covered everything in the article, but if I missed a point that it made, let me know.)

A lot of that article seems to be based on the assumptions that [Trump is different](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/08/silver-datalab-moartrump-2.png?w=610&amp;h=397) and that [he is popular among Republican voters](https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/silver-feature-trumpnew-table.png?w=610&amp;h=596). It didn't back these assumptions up with any data; it just took them and ran with it. With that, you can easily argue that Nate Silver is wrong--their negations well-backed by data and consequently form the foundations of Silver's argument.

So, to convince me that Silver is wrong, I'd have see that:

1. Trump is well-liked by Republican voters, or
2. Trump is fundamentally different.

Again, these two statements are contradicted by the charts I have presented.

*Edit: [Here's a graph of the poll numbers over time](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/us/2016_republican_presidential_nomination-3823.html) As you can see, since early August he has moved up and down a little, but for the most part he has stayed within roughly 5 points of the poll numbers at the time the video was made.

Edit: In response to your most recent edit: what failed predictions did he make in that video? The only real prediction that I heard was that Clinton would run, which, as you said, wasn't very bold. I'm not saying that Nate Silver makes bold predictions, though; I'm saying he makes correct ones. Why would he make a bold prediction three and a half years in advance? At that time, he had very little data to work with, so if he wanted to be accurate, he could only state the obvious.",1449424532,cxp97l1

I agree! I did my phd in applied math, and something we learned in grad school (back when I was planning to be an academic) is that funding resources for research are scarce so it's important to be as PC and uncontroversial as possible. Now that I'm in the private sector and actually generate revenues for my pay I can afford to let my hair down a little and be judged on my merits instead of others' opinions of me.

5522,eclataurora,"Very interesting point. I was also involved with research and the idea that grants (internal especially) are subjected to a fair amount of nepotism resonates well. As for the idea of party line, a Michael Bloomberg commencement speech at Harvard makes note of the disparity in political viewpoints in the Ivy Leagues and how it may affect students learning. 


“In the 2012 presidential race, according to Federal Election Commission data, 96 percent of all campaign contributions from Ivy League faculty and employees went to Barack Obama. Ninety-six percent. There was more disagreement among the old Soviet Politburo than there is among Ivy League donors. That statistic should give us pause – and I say that as someone who endorsed President Obama for reelection – because let me tell you, neither party has a monopoly on truth or God on its side. When 96 percent of Ivy League donors prefer one candidate to another, you have to wonder whether students are being exposed to the diversity of views that a great university should offer. Diversity of gender, ethnicity, and orientation is important. But a university cannot be great if its faculty is politically homogenous. In fact, the whole purpose of granting tenure to professors is to ensure that they feel free to conduct research on ideas that run afoul of university politics and societal norms.""

5560,STUMPIN_FOR_TRUMP,"Here is a response I wrote up. Being a smaller kind of accountant, and also not bring around to know the laws then. I did my best to simplify it.


This article is flawed completely so let's go through the points so people stop repeating memes. 

""1974, the real estate empire of Trump's father, Fred, was worth about $200 million. Trump is one of five siblings, making his stake at that time worth about $40 million. If someone were to invest $40 million in a S&amp;P 500 index in August 1974"". 

Flaw one: This is assuming he owned his father's wealth at the age of 28. If I am from a middle class house hold. Go to college get a job. Live in an apartment in the city I am doing well saving for a down payment on a house. I have 25k in the bank. This article would assume I am worth 525k as my father owns the house I used to live in. 

 ""If someone were to invest $40 million in a S&amp;P 500 index in August 1974, reinvest all dividends, not cash out and have to pay capital gains, and pay nothing in investment fees, he'd wind up with about $3.4 billion come August 2015...If one factors in dividend taxes and a fee of 0.15 percent — which is triple Vanguard's actual fee for an exchanged traded S&amp;P 500 fund — the total only falls to $2.3 billion.""

Flaw 2 OK so he took his fathers net worth. And translated it directly to cash. How did he get this money? Was it a gift from his father? That would be taxed at around 50% in 1974, did his father die in 1974, well no he died in 1998. 

So must of been a gift just for Donald. So his father dissolves a fifth of his real estate empire. Oh damn he has to pay tax on that too for earned income on sale. In 1974 the top tax rate for any income over 200k was taxed at 70% Or if this was a funky corporate exchange would be taxed at the corporate rate of 48% (can I round that to 50% just to be easier here I'll add 2% at the end) 

So Trump SR. Sells 1/5 his buildings to secure Donald's future. 40 million dollars. Let's say only 20% of that was corporate income as I'm sure he had some expenses as well. Probably not 32 million but just to be conservative. So he was taxed on 8 million dollars at 50%. So the net worth is now 36 million dollars. 

Then he gives his son a gift of 36 million dollars. Which is then taxed as a gift at 50%. Donald receives his 18 million dollars.

Flaw 3: He puts this money into an index fund. Using the calculator provided this would be a return of 8961. 307% damn he did well. So 18 million dollars with that return rate would be 1.613 billion dollars. So Donald has a net worth currently of 1.613 billion dollars. Sadly Donald died of lack of food and shelter as he put all his money into an index fund. So he worked a day job I guess and lived on that. 

OK so Donald it's 2015 you have a net worth of 1.613 billion dollars you are 69 Years old you decide now is the time to cash out and live like a king. Damn he has to pay capital gains tax of 20%. The year is now 2015 and Donald Trump has a net worth of 1.2904 billion dollars. He has lived a middle class life with the secret he is worth 1.2904 billion dollars. Makes sense living in a life of luxury sounds dumb. So let's see the real present. Donald trump worth between 4 billion and 10 billion dollars. While living in a life of luxury owning private jets, even gets so far as running for President. Which life would you choose? This article is meant to discredit someone to people who know less than nothing about investing.

2. His foreign policy temperament.

&gt;Also, it was my understanding a large part of this country felt overlooked by the goverment, thinking it mostly helpes the richest percent of the population - how will Trump counteract this problem?

Yes, Trump is rich, but he's not Scrooge McDuck. Look up his tax plan yourself. [Hell, look up all of his positions](https://www.donaldjtrump.com/positions). The middle and lower classes will flourish once we get better trade deals and stop having to compete with third-world slave labor.

His $4bn net worth is exactly how he's able to make America work for everyone again, not just the rich. He doesn't have to listen to a single rent-seeking lobbyist. He's the only one on-stage who's explicitly denounced corruption. Sanders is somewhat similar in that regard, but [he does have some shady ties to large unions](https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=Career&amp;cid=N00000528), so he's not completely string-free like Trump is.

The cloud of radiation from a nuclear bomb could spread tens to hundreds of square miles, whereas a dirty bomb’s radiation could be dispersed within a few blocks or miles of the explosion.

First, tech companies, particularly Facebook, have been major supporters of H1B visas and immigration as a way to keep wages down. So that contributes to my argument regarding crony capitalism. And it's true that cheap agr. labor keeps prices down, but that's essentially saying it's cool to exploit hispanic labor.

They understand very well what they're doing, by playing with our emotions and pride and by trying to undermine the ideals and values that this country stands for. They may seem like a bunch of uncultured towel-heads in a cave (the towel-head cave part is true), but they are actually very calculated. Many of them have lived in the West and know where the nerves are, by studying the history that led up to WWII for instance. Unfortunately, it does seem like it is beginning to work with recent rhetoric I've been hearing. 

Regarding the Muslim community, it's difficult to do so - the reason is that there is no centralization within the Muslim ummah - it's not like there is a ""Muslim Vatican"" or something like that. There's no large governing body over all Muslims and it's unfortunate, because I would love to excommunicate each and every single person with radical beliefs. 

That, combined with the fact that our ally Saudi Arabia is funding much of the radical institutions, and the fact that we [unfortunately armed and funded the inception of ISIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1oEoCRkLRI) puts us in a tough position. What can the Muslims do when there's no authority to listen to?

As a people, yes we condemn them as I posted in another comment. Peaceful rallies isn't as good television as burning American flags. But how to get that message to a greater people? 

Oh, and as for disavowing the eateries in the Quran which allow the monsters, each and every moderate Muslim does - we say that it was a historical based story for that time. The problem is, with the decentralization everyone has their own Muslim Priest they can listen to, and it's these people that can implement radicalism.

The establishment of a caliphate on it's own isn't really something all that nefarious - caliphate by definition means: 

""A caliphate (Arabic: خِلافة‎ khilāfa) is a form of Islamic government led by a caliph"" 

By the evidence, it doesn't appear that he was sympathetic to the ISIS way of life or that there was evidence of any planned attacks. The establishment of a caliphate in a Muslim country has been done in Turkey, in Saudi, and I believe in Morocco in the past century. I don't believe they are referring to establishing a caliphate here in the US as they would have been specific regarding that.

There is a difference between foreign Muslim's and American muslims. Unfortunately many foreign Muslim's originate from countries where they are taught to dislike the US and our culture, this coupled with the incompatibility between much of our culture/values with that of Islam creates a situation where letting these people in is not in our best interest. 

Immigration into our country is to benefit the US,  people who come to live in the US are expected to contribute to the greatness of our country. Immigration is supposed to be mutually beneficial. Immigrants can take part in the American dream and the country benefits from their efforts. 

Letting people in who have a good chance of not wanting to partake in the American dream or any other part of our culture and instead dislike the country... Is absurd. 

In my opinion if you love this country and want to contribute to its greatness you are American. If you do not meet those above criteria you are not American,  despite where you live or what your citizenship is.  To me,  you can be a US citizen and not be American, likewise you can be a foreign citizen and still be an American.  This applies to all races/religion/SES's. 

It is unfortunate we cannot look into people's hearts and find those who will love this country. So errors will be made with in all types of immigration, but we can do our best to ensure the right people are let in. 

The government is trusted with the safety of the American people and it obligated to put our welfare above the welfare of foreigners.  

With this in mind.  Letting people who are likely to not love this country would be a failure of the government to perform it's duties. 

We have no obligation to let people immigrate, those we do let in should represent a clear benefit for the country.

If you let people have guns then every year 20 people or so will die in a school shooting.  That doesn't mean we should ban guns.  Its just a societal cost of freedom.  Same thing with muslim immigrants.  
 
I am sort of against refugees though.  I sort of like immigrants because the one thing they seem to have more than regular americans is hustle... and I think its a very appealing quality.  However to be a immigrant is tough.  You have to adjust to a new culture, get a job, learn a new language, ect.  
 
Alternatively, if you are refugee they stick in a town with a bunch of other refugees and set you up with food and housing.  You don't even have to sneak into the country or figure out how to immigrate here.  
 
I guess I think migrants are in the american spirit, whereas refugees are not.  Also, there are like a billion people that could be refugees in the US, so I don't get why were are just selecting a special few thousand.  Its like they are winning the lotto or something.  ",1449554189,cxr95l8

6149,southp4w,"Pew may be a ""reputable source"" but doesn't mean it's not ""questionable"" because its more complex than that. if you actually read the full report you'll notice a few things:

1) (p. 35) the sample size is pretty small-- 560 people in a country of 4.3 million with 54% being muslim is nothing (yes their sample size is 1000, which isn't any better but the data uses 560 (N = sample size). Also note the individuals were selected via multi-stage clustering and disadvantages with this kind of approach are 1) high subjectivity levels and 2) findings can never be 100% representative of the population.

2) Notice the data sets for Turkey and Jordan are a tad off in their total, which can change the way its portrayed (this is due to rounding, which impacts numbers as you may know).

3) The data was obtained via face-to-face interviews, this introduces issues in the validity of the study which PEW does address (""..conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of opinion polls"" p.22). Also for example, apostasy laws may exist in these places and thus, individuals may avoid speaking against it. A ton of internal validity or external can impact any of this.

4) It was created in 2010, so views may have changed in the past 5 years.

5) Data is only collected in 1 month (less than that actually), in ONLY 1 year. If we had data from a few other years to support this, I would back it more but unfortunately thats not the case.

Just because its PEW and published doesn't mean the study doesn't have weaknesses. I'm not saying all that i address is 100% correct, but issues can exist and you shouldn't take everything you read from even a .org site as 100% right.",1449554677,cxr9d2g

6206,zamgoesham,"You're not wrong, and it doesn't take a genius to realize that violent crimes in the name of religion occur more so with muslims. 

You have to realize that islam has MANY different branches and sects that actually vary in their beliefs and ideologies. I myself am an ""Ismaili"" muslim, a very progressive branch of Shiite islam that has donated billions of dollars to charity, built schools and universities, hospitals etc, both in western and third world societies. Look up the Aga Khan Foundation/Aga Khan Development Network and you will see. Unfortunately, we don't get as much media coverage and recognition.

Unfortunately, there are also branches of islams (usually sunni) that are less progressive and have more antiquated beliefs. Thus, people from these groups tend to believe more strongly in things like Sharia law. 

My point is that it is hard to put every ""Muslim"" into one category, as there are many different groups of us each with different beliefs. Thus, I find the validity of those stats questionable as I have to ask which type of muslims (sunni/shia) they asked, from which location, and from which sect of islam.",1449557330,cxraeg1

I have many Muslim friends and hate what is happening, I really don't want there to be a xenophobic tirade against innocent people. But we have to meet in the middle somewhere here. We have to stand united. A poll said that 51% of Muslim Americans don't condemn terrorists for wanting to kill Americans. These results, they may be slightly skewed upward, but it is still a very scary thing for us to see on the other side. You see, we tend to universally condemn any group in our religion that spreads hate, the biggest examples being Westboro Baptist Church and the KKK.

It was 51% who believed that they should have Sharia law and courts here, and 20% who believed using violence in US to make Sharia law happen was justified.

And yes, that would be the basis of such a program, to investigate and decide quickly if it was radical. Standard for radical could be decided between our leaders and Muslim leaders in America. We do need to watch for Christian terrorists too, but it's harder because they're more infrequent and don't often have any allegiance to any radical Christian groups.

Yes, the reaction to these things has been extreme. We live in an age where these rights were granted long enough ago that younger generations can take them for granted. What seems to us the way the world has always been is really very new. But the repercussions of bigotry still echo today, in segregated neighborhoods, advertising, the justice system, drug laws, education, etc, etc, etc.

But now we have a reaction to the reaction. Some people are tired of watching what they say as the world grows up around them. Which means more racial intolerance, more ethnic slurs, more misogynistic name-calling...which will in turn provoke yet another reaction.

It just seems to me that Islam has a greater propensity than pretty much other religion towards encouraging fundamentalism and violence among the people who follow it.  For instance, the most starkly visible thing to me as someone who lives in a major U.S. city is that pretty much every religious group I see has integrated pretty well into society except for Muslims, who seem to wall themselves off and keep to their own beliefs and traditions.  It makes me worried for what will happen as more and more of them come in and eventually begin to make up the majority of some towns and cities.  No offense meant to you.  I do not believe all Muslims are bad people, just that Islam is a bad religion.

6500,QuantumCatBox,"&gt;If correctly done

And how do you know if the Center for Security Policy (CSP) conducted a proper survey given that they do not release their methodology on their website? One of the great aspects of Pew and Gallup are that they have all their survey questions posted *and* a  section dedicated to survey methodology for each separate poll. CSP doesn't even conduct its own surveys, it partners out to [The Poling Company WomenTrend](http://pollingcompany.com/expertise/nonprofit-advocacy/) whose [political clients](http://pollingcompany.com/expertise/political/) include:

* African American *Republican* Leadership Coalition
* Camden County *Republican* Party
* Cape May County *Republican* Party
* Cumberland County *Republican* Party
* National Federal of *Republican* Women
* *Republican* Jewish Coalition
* and numerous *Republican* politicians

Under their [Quantitative Research](http://pollingcompany.com/services/quantitative-research/) section they state:

&gt;An internet survey is the perfect option if your client has access to respondent email lists. One of the many benefits of web-based surveys is that participants can complete the survey at their own convenience, any time day or night. Participants will receive an emailed invitation along with a URL address and a one-time use user ID and password to participate in the survey.

To me, that sounds like CSP provides a list of email addresses and then The Polling Company does the work of sending out the poll. If that is accurate, then CSP is deciding the population that will receive the questions, thus making their sample size not only a non-probability based sample, but also one ripe with selection bias.

According to the [American Association for Publican Opinion Research](http://www.aapor.org/AAPORKentico/Education-Resources/For-Researchers/Poll-Survey-FAQ/Why-Sampling-Works.aspx), which sets standards and ethics for polling:

&gt;Basically, whenever a sample is chosen without specifying the target population and without knowing the probabilities of selecting a given respondent, it is a non-probability sample. That challenge with these types of samples is that there is absolutely no way to know how well (or how badly as the case may be) such a sample does at representing the views of the total population. Internet-opt in surveys - a ""take this poll"" or ""tell us what you think"" box on a website - are perhaps the most obvious examples. In these cases, the pollster has no idea who is responding to the question. The ""sample"" is people who happened to be on that website and decided to answer the questions. There is no way to know who answered and who skipped and no way to know what the ""total population"" would be.

The frustration stems from the fact that polling is a science, and one that requires generally accepted methodologies and transparency in the work. But, a majority of people likely to do not understand the underlying principles and statistics that make properly conducted polls so powerful. Therefore, small ""marketing"" firms are able to use the respect that is typically dignified in the term ""poll"" to conduct a shoddy poll that does not merit the respect of the term. Trying to explain why the results are invalid requires time (as can be seen from this post) and assumes the listener will grasp and understand the underlying concepts. When it is a political poll dealing with a contentious issue, this is almost impossible, as any explanation that is contrary to the results one desires to see will be ignored as demonstrative of a liberal or conservative bias.",1449565263,cxrctn1

The reason I'm worried about Muslims is that the extremists among them want to cause as much damage to as many people as possible.  The ONLY reason they have not detonated a nuke on our soil is they don't have access to one (and I hope they never will).  These people are animals with no thought to decency and no respect for life.  Honestly, the force multiplers are so great that I think it is right to be very worried.

I also think his business record is impressive, and having politicians that are actually demonstrably good at something is always nice.

However, I think there are some pretty significant problems with a Trump presidency as well.  Trump says what is on his mind, but that makes it clear he doesn't have a great grasp of what is happening in the world.  For example, his debate answer on the TPP where he seemed to think China was involved.  Why does he have an opinion on the TPP if he doesn't even know which countries are involved with it?  He has bold, definite opinions, but these aren't backed up by evidence or contemplation in some cases.  That's a dangerous mix in my opinion.

Similarly Trump is quick to say that he will be really tough on ISIS.  The specifics of his plans though rarely exceed ""Bomb the hell out of them"" or statements of that nature.  Sometimes he talks about taking all of the oil, or giving it to American companies.  This sounds a lot like Trump is talking about waging wars for profit - or in other words, killing lots of innocent people so we can steal their stuff and make money on it.  I give Trump credit for candidly stating that this is his plan, but I don't think it is a moral plan.  Nor is it a plan that is likely to promote the long term safety of our country.  Fighting wars to take resources will create future enemies for us - both out of the friends and families of our victims, and out of people who fear they will be our next targets.

Finally, Trump frequently says things that appear to be untrue.  When confronted on the matter, he tends to double down, refusing to admit when he is wrong.  A basic example of this is when he claimed that he saw thousands of people celebrating in Jersey City after 9/11.  Now, I could understand if he confused some Muslims celebrating that day from a different country in the world, which may have happened, with a news story he saw about Jersey City.  However, when he is challenged on it, when he can't produce the video of the celebrations or similar evidence, when he can't explain why there aren't records of that, he doesn't back down.  He insists that he is right.  The ideal person wouldn't make mistakes, but once you've made them, it is surely better to correct your mistakes than persist in believing them, or deny the corrections.

Trump is a good business man.  He is also admirably direct about what he believes.  But he also has some serious flaws that I think are unacceptable in a Presidential candidate. ",1449569257,cxrds0h

6594,megrussell,"&gt; Trump isn't kicking out the Muslims that are legally living in the USA.

Okay, just help me understand Trump's position on Muslim Americans and Muslims in general. As far as I've followed his announcements of what he would do as President, he would

* create a Federal database of all Muslims living in America, and
* use this database to track the movements of all Muslims in America,
* institute surveillance on Muslim communities and on mosques,
* shut down mosques in the United States,
* deport all Syrian refugees who have already been admitted to the United States,
* institute a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States, and even
* bar Muslim-American citizens living abroad from returning home.

That sounds like he would seriously crack down on an entire religion/ethnicity if he became President. In fact, many of his proposals seem to be directly in violation of the Constitution, and sound a lot more like a totalitarian regime than a democratic nation.

Muslim terrorists are much more sinster - all they want pretty much is the destruction of the west - to the point where they're attacking Russia, France, etc and who knows how many other places in the coming years with seemingly the deliberate intent to try to start a war.  It's insanity.  If they had nukes, bioweapons, etc. there is no doubt at all they would have used them.  There is pretty much nothing we can do short of becoming territory under their caliphate to make them stop.  And even then they'd be killing us for sport.

Generally speaking, Pew and Gallup are the leading poll organizations that have rock solid methodologies and are generally transparent with their research designs.

Speaking of which, if you do find that type of polling data alarming, then you will be shocked at this [Gallup Poll](http://www.gallup.com/poll/148763/muslim-americans-no-justification-violence.aspx) that was conducted in Aug. 2011, the 10 year anniversary of 9/11. The poll was conducted over the course of a month (not a couple of days) using land-line and cell phone only owners (not an internet opt-in) and demographics were weighted to U.S. Census Bureau figures (not just raw). The sample size was 2,482 adults (not 600), and the methodology is actual listed on the site.

Here are some questions and results:

&gt;Some people think that for the military to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?

* Muslim: 78% Never / 21% Sometimes
* Protestant: 38% Never / 58% Sometimes
* Catholic: 39% Never / 58% Sometimes
* Jewish: 43% Never / 52% Sometimes
* Mormon: 33% Never / 64% Sometimes (yikes!?)
* No Religion: 56% Never / 43% Sometimes

&gt;Some people think that for an individual person or a small group of persons to target and kill civilians is sometimes justified, while others think that kind of violence is never justified. Which is your opinion?

* Muslim: 89% Never / 11% Sometimes
* Protestant: 71% Never / 26% Sometimes
* Catholic: 71% Never / 27% Sometimes
* Jewish: 75% Never / 22% Sometimes
* Mormon: 79% Never / 19% Sometimes
* No Religion: 76% Never / 23% Sometimes

While the fact that anyone would say ever answer ""sometimes"" to this question, regardless of their religious affiliation, is alarming, Muslims seem to be on the low end in those results.

Margin of Errors at 95% confidence levels after data is reweighted:

* Muslim - 6.6%
* Protestant - 4.7%
* Catholic - 6.4%
* Jewish - 7.3% 
* Mormon - 8.3%
* No Religion - 7.8%

I'm going by [this article by politifact](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2015/nov/24/donald-trumps-comments-database-american-muslims/) that examined whether or not Donald Trump actually wants a registry for all Muslims. It seems to do a good job at linking the actual statements, and seems to be fairly reliable.

From that article, it originally seemed as if Trump generally endorsed the idea of a database or a registry whenever he was asked, and it also seemed that he endorsed the idea of making it mandatory for Muslims to be registered. However, there was the possibility of a mix up with the topics of the wall, and of the topic of refugees.

Then there were big headlines and some confusion. At a later rally he said about the Muslim registry:

&gt;So the database - I said yeah, that’s alright fine. But they also said the wall, and I said the wall, and I was referring to the wall, but database is okay, and watch list is okay, and surveillance is okay. If you don’t mind, I want to be - I want to surveil. I want surveillance of these people that are coming in - the Trojan Horse - I want to know who the hell they are.

http://www.jihadwatch.org/2012/01/childsuicide-bombers-they-told-us-the-bombs-would-not-kill-usonly-the-americans-would-die-and-you

From a reddit comment from one of those threads: 

&gt;""Heard an interesting NPR piece the other day
about how Boko Haram uses young girls to be suicide
bombers. They basically give them a choice between dying
as a martyr quickly, or dying slowly and unpleasantly. They
teach this by example, and only use their own children
beacuse girls they kidnapped ""do not deserve"" a martyr's
death. Some girls have run away and escaped, but most
don't. ""

They're completely nuts!! Holy shit right? Why leave the innocent people to this retards? 

""Hurr durr Muslims are like that.""

Wow no, thank god they aren't, imagine 1.6 billion people being like that, can you imagine? We would all be dead.

""But then again why won't muslims themselves do something about it??""

Uhh sorry, but they are: 

&gt;""people were
protesting in the streets against ISIS in ISIS held areas,""In
the meantime, dozens of people took to the street in
Manbij to protest against ISIS atrocities. However, the
group opened fire on the protesters, killing at least two and
wounding several others. The rest of the protesters were
arrested, said activists in Manbij. This is the third protest
organized by the people of Manbij in two months, calling
for the departure of the terror group from their city and
denouncing its violations against civilians.""

Another case of muslims doing something:

I think these issues arise because Trump usually rambles on, and usually fails to clearly outline his proposals.

That leaves a lot of room for interpretation, and people who are afraid that Trump would institute many policies that would discriminate based on religion or ethnicity will obviously interpret it to mean that he wants to shut down all mosques.

In WWII we stopped Asian immigrants and sent the existing ones to a camp where they could be monitored. Why? Cruelty? NO. We did it because there's no way to know who was here for noble reasons and who was undercover and a spy working for the Japanese. We haven't learned from then, so we let in Muslims because God forbid we profile when the majority of their kind support some for of radical Islam, many secretly (or openly for that matter) support what ISIS is doing, and they support Jihad against the west because they hate our ""decadent ways"". There's NO way to know anymore who is here for good and who comes in acting good to get in then goes on a rampage. There is no way to know. San Bernardino just proved that.

As your articles have pointed out, I'm sure that there are some Muslims who hate ISIS and what it's doing.   I'm sure most of the refugees are well intentioned, good people.  However, all it takes is for a few dozen terrorists to sneak in among them, and they could wreak havoc on a massive scale inside our country.  

That said, the US does not have a responsibility to every single person in need everywhere in the world.  Unfortunately, even if no ISIS members manage to sneak in among the refugees, and even if none of those refugees later become radicalized on our soil (both unlikely scenarios) the fact is most of the people from the middle east hold beliefs about Sharia, women's rights, cartoons about Muhammed, etc that are all antithetical to our values.  As we have seen with the discoveries in the mosques of Paris and Molenbeek in Brussels, when Muslims immigrate they tend to form their own communities and not fully integrate with the society around them, which makes it easy for extremism to arise eventually in such an us vs. them culture.

I'm not even American but this is exactly why people are becoming islamophobic! There seems to be a prevailing view among all muslims that Islam somehow supersedes national governments and laws. You don't hear the Vatican or other church bodies encouraging Syriac Christians to establish their own crusade/holy land, despite their arguable right to do so. Christians, Hindus, Buddhists and others may not be perfect and violence may flare up from time to time, but not a single one of these religions has been advocating and *normalizing* the taking of territory in the name of god, let alone in the name of Jihad. The exception here is of course another global religion which is on par with Islam for this sort of territorial behaviour. *cough cough* Judaism *cough cough*

Islam may be a peaceful religion and the many muslims I have met and befriended have been generally indistinguishable from ""westerners"" from an ideological perspective. However this defensive attitude *is* the problem! Muslims need to stand up and criticize all extremist views and any violence or jihad as being historical artifacts of a bygone era. But except for minority voices or hollow words muslims largely accept and encourage war and conflict when it is their faction and their sect doing it. This moral relativism and two-faced attitude is why American people are losing trust in all muslims. Personally, I still judge people based on their actions, but many Americans judge people on their ideology.

We know that Americans are also guilty of far worse than many muslims are guilty of - not implying the two are mutually exclusive by the way - but last I checked this was not due to religious influences.   ",1449580522,cxrguk0

&gt;
&gt;“If a person is a Muslim, goes overseas and comes back, they can come back. They're a citizen. That's different,” Trump said. “But we have to figure things out.”

Trump is a narcissist who can't handle criticism, real or imagined. He would make international relations an absolute nightmare.

These are just things he straight up *made up*, and then, when called out, he screamed and shouted about how shitty whoever was criticizing him was.



Oh, and putting Muslims on a national registry! How would he go about doing that? Monitor and mark all mosque-goers? Track everyone who buys a qur'an? Go around handing out pork and marking those who refuse? Walk around with a paint color gradient scale and mark anyone who ranks at about a ""cappuccino""? Let's face it, he has no *plan* for any of this, just a vague direction.


Finally, his blockade on Muslims! How would one go about doijg *that*? He wants to isolate and slowly ban an entire ideology, and he's providing no rewsonable explanation as to *how*.

Around the age of 11 or 12, Bill's parents began to have concerns about his behavior. He was doing well in school, but he seemed bored and withdrawn at times. His parents worried he might become a loner. Though they were strong believers in public education, when Bill turned 13, they enrolled him at Seattle's Lakeside School, an exclusive preparatory school. He blossomed in nearly all his subjects, excelling in math and science, but also doing very well in drama and English.

While at Lakeside School, a Seattle computer company offered to provide computer time for the students. The Mother's Club used proceeds from the school's rummage sale to purchase a teletype terminal for students to use. Bill Gates became entranced with what a computer could do and spent much of his free time working on the terminal. He wrote a tic-tac-toe program in BASIC computer language that allowed users to play against the computer.

It was at Lakeside School where Bill met Paul Allen, who was two years his senior. The two became fast friends, bonding on their common enthusiasm over computers, even though they were very different. Allen was more reserved and shy. Bill was feisty and at times combative. They both spent much of their free time together working on programs. Occasionally, they disagreed and would clash over who was right or who should run the computer lab. On one occasion, their argument escalated to the point where Allen banned Gates from the computer lab. On another occasion, Gates and Allen had their school computer privileges revoked for taking advantage of software glitches to obtain free computer time from the company that provided the computers. After their probation, they were allowed back in the computer lab when they offered to debug the program. During this time, Gates developed a payroll program for the computer company the boys hacked into, and a scheduling program for the school.

In 1970, at the age of 15, Bill Gates went into business with his pal, Paul Allen. They developed ""Traf-o-Data,"" a computer program that monitored traffic patterns in Seattle, and netted $20,000 for their efforts. Gates and Allen wanted to start their own company, but Gates's parents wanted him to finish school and go on to college where they hoped he would work to become a lawyer.

Bill Gates graduated from Lakeside in 1973. He scored 1590 out of 1600 on the college SAT test, a feat of intellectual achievement that for several years he boasted about when introducing himself to new people.

Gates enrolled at Harvard University in the fall, originally thinking of a career in law. But his freshman year saw him spend more of his time in the computer lab than in class. Gates did not really have a study regimen. Instead, he could get by on a few hours of sleep, cram for a test, and pass with a reasonable grade.

Gates remained in contact with Paul Allen, who, after attending Washington State University for two years, dropped out and moved to Boston, Massachusetts, to work for Honeywell. In the summer of 1974, Gates joined Allen at Honeywell. During this time, Allen showed Gates an edition of Popular Electronics magazine featuring an article on the Altair 8800 mini-computer kit. Both boys were fascinated with the possibilities that this computer could create in the world of personal computing. The Altair was made by a small company in Albuquerque, New Mexico, called Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS). Gates and Allen contacted the company, proclaiming that they were working on a BASIC software program that would run the Altair computer. In reality, they didn't have an Altair to work with or the code to run it. But they wanted to know if MITS was interested in someone developing such software. MITS was, and its president Ed Roberts asked the boys for a demonstration. Gates and Allen scrambled, spending the next two months writing the software at Harvard's computer lab. Allen traveled to Albuquerque for a test run at MITS, never having tried it out on an Altair computer. It worked perfectly. Allen was hired at MITS and Gates soon left Harvard to work with him, much to his parents' dismay. In 1975, Gates and Allen formed a partnership they called Micro-Soft, a blend of ""micro-computer"" and ""software.""

 ""If individuals know that their actions and dispositions are constantly being observed, commented on and criticized, they find it much harder to do anything that deviates from accepted social behavior. There does not even have to be an explicit threat of retaliation. Under these circumstances they find it better simply to conform. This is the situation characterized in George Orwell's 1984 where the pervasive surveillance of ""Big Brother"" was enough to keep most citizens under rigid control.

Therefore privacy, as protection from excessive scrutiny, is necessary if individuals are to be free to be themselves. Everyone needs some room to break social norms, to engage in small ""permissible deviations"" that help define a person's individuality. People need to be able to think outrageous thoughts, make scandalous statements and pick their noses once in a while. They need to be able to behave in ways that are not dictated to them by the surrounding society. If every appearance, action, word and thought of theirs is captured and posted on a social network visible to the rest of the world, they lose that freedom to be themselves. As Brian Stelter wrote in the New York Times on the loss of anonymity in today's online world, ""The collective intelligence of the Internet's two billion users, and the digital fingerprints that so many users leave on Web sites, combine to make it more and more likely that every embarrassing video, every intimate photo, and every indelicate e-mail is attributed to its source, whether that source wants it to be or not. This intelligence makes the public sphere more public than ever before and sometimes forces personal lives into public view.""

You are right that certain conditions need to exist to bring about extremism on this kind of scale(that may not exist comparably with Chrisitian). But i still believe that Islam also has more of an endemic problem with religious violence than Christianity.

The texts that these extremists are using to justify their jihad apply to all cultural situations. I dont think their is any geo-politcal situation that you could throw these radicals into that would change what they believe. Obviously, I cant say this for sure.

Honestly, looking at the Quran I think the argument for Islam having a more endemic problem is self evident. Sure, the Bible has some horrible violence in the old testament, but these old laws were for the Jews and have no authority over the Christians of the new testament.

7045,pillowattack,"Mongols were highly tolerant of most religions during the early Mongol Empire, and typically sponsored several at the same time. At the time of Genghis Khan in the 13th century, virtually every religion had found converts, from Buddhism to Christianity and Manichaeanism to Islam. To avoid strife, Genghis Khan set up an institution that ensured complete religious freedom, though he himself was a shamanist. Under his administration, all religious leaders were exempt from taxation, and from public service.[1] Mongol emperors were known for organizing competitions of religious debates among clerics, and these would draw large audiences.

Initially there were few formal places of worship, because of the nomadic lifestyle. However, under Genghis's successor Ögedei, several building projects were undertaken in the Mongol capital of Karakorum. Along with palaces, Ogedei built houses of worship for the Buddhist, Muslim, Christian, and Taoist followers. The dominant religions at that time were Shamanism, Tengriism and Buddhism, although Ogodei's wife was a Christian.[2] In later years of the empire, three of the four principal khanates embraced Islam, as Islam was favored over other religions.[3][4][5] The Yuan dynasty mainly adopted Tibetan Buddhism while there were other religions practiced in the east of the Mongol Empire.

7048,Hrash0,"&gt; But i still believe that Islam also has more of an endemic problem with religious violence than Christianity.

You cannot honestly have a decent grasp of the history of Christianity and still believe this. 

&gt; I dont think their is any geo-politcal situation that you could throw these radicals into that would change what they believe.

What they believe and what they do with those beliefs is separate. Or do you think that people on the far right end of the Christian spectrum such as the WBC and their ilk, numerous abortion clinic bombers, neo Nazis, etc etc have beliefs less violent and less ass-backwards as ISIS? 

&gt; Sure, the Bible has some horrible violence in the old testament, but these old laws were for the Jews and have no authority over the Christians of the new testament.

And yet the Bible contains both. You can't pick and choose which aspects of your religion are 'true' just because the brutal parts make you uncomfortable. 

And I don't hear people bitching about Judaism's 'endemic predisposition to violence.'

You don't have a literalist interpretation of the Bible, you're not 100% to the book Christian, and you should be proud. 

There are literally millions of Muslims with the same view of the shitty parts of their book as you have of the shitty parts in yours. They take the good parts of their book and follow them, realizing that not all of it is relevant today because times change. 

Sure, Islam was literally spread by the sword. But you must understand that in those times, religion was often a unifying factor for a tribe or tribes and if the religion was not strict and explicit about how to behave and how to self-perpetuate, the tribe could be wiped out. 

TL; DR: all religions, especially Abrahamic ones, are big stinky pieces of shit, and you mustn't let current historical circumstance  lull you into the belief that one of them is extra smelly. It's not. They all suck. ",1449594487,cxrovmu

7145,Windupferrari,"That article is being incredibly charitable to Donald on several of the points, and ironically, this proposed muslim ban unequivocally scores him at least a couple points on that list.

1.“The Cult of Tradition”, combining cultural syncretism with a rejection of modernism.”

Banning the immigration of an entire religion is a pretty thorough rejection of modern ideals about freedom of religion.

2.“The Cult of Action for Action’s Sake”, which dictates that action is of value in itself, and should be taken without intellectual reflection. This, says Eco, is connected with anti-intellectualism and irrationalism, and often manifests in attacks on modern culture and science.”

I don't know what Adams is talking about. Denying climate change without a scientific basis is irrationalism in my book.

3.“Disagreement Is Treason” - fascism devalues intellectual discourse and critical reasoning as barriers to action.”

This seems like something that wouldn't crop up until the supposed fascist was in power and going full ""I am the state"" mode.

4.“Fear of Difference”, which fascism seeks to exploit and exacerbate, often in the form of racism or an appeal against foreigners and immigrants.”

Can't possibly deny this one anymore.

5.“Appeal to a Frustrated Middle Class”, fearing economic pressure from the demands and aspirations of lower social groups.”

He's appealing to the middle class by blaming economic problems on immigrants (a lower social group). A lot of politicians do this, but that doesn't mean he gets a pass.

6.“Obsession with a Plot” and the hyping-up of an enemy threat; This often involves an appeal to xenophobia (such as the German elite’s ‘fear'of the 1930s Jewish populace’s businesses and well-doings, see also anti-Semitism) with an identification of their being an internal security threat: He also cites Pat Robertson’s book The New World Order as a prominent example of a plot obsession.”

If a ban on muslim immigration isn't an appeal to xenophobia, I don't know what is.

7.“Pacifism is Trafficking with the Enemy” because “Life is Permanent Warfare” - there must always be an enemy to fight; Both fascist Germany under Hitler and Italy under Mussolini worked first to organize and clean up their respective countries and then build the war machines that they later intended to and did use, despite Germany being under restrictions of the Versailles treaty to NOT build a military force. This principle leads to a fundamental contradiction within fascism: the incompatibility of ultimate triumph with perpetual war.”

Trump seems pretty damn hawkish. No Hitler levels, but more than anyone else in the campaign.

8.“Contempt for the Weak” - although a fascist society is elitist, everybody in the society is educated to become a hero; for example: the 1930s Germans, especially Hitler labeled Jews inferior humans thus weak as well as the physically disabled, the mentally retarded and mentally ill as weak—thus these “weak” or unwanteds were eliminated (executed) or “exterminated” (the Jews, or even Germans with disabilities).”

Trump is about one step removed from wanting to expel hispanics and muslims from the country, which is what Hitler originally wanted to do to the Jews. Even if he's not on Hitler's level, he's far and away the closest a legitimate candidate for president has ever come.

9.“Selective Populism” - the People have a common will, which is not delegated but directed by a dictator; This casts doubt upon a democratic institution, because the leader and government “no longer represent the Voice of the People”.

I'll give him a pass here because basically everyone shits on Congress nowadays.

10.“Newspeak” - fascism employs and promotes an impoverished vocabulary in order to limit critical reasoning.”

Not that I've seen.

11.“Non-truths &amp; Lying/Spread of Propaganda""

[Trump definitely has a strained relationship with the truth.](http://www.politifact.com/personalities/donald-trump/)

Even if I'm being extremely charitable, Trump hits on 5 of these criteria. And as Umberto Eco, who created these criteria, said ""it is enough that one of them be present to allow fascism to coagulate around it.""

This looks like Trump didn't understand the issue, even if it turns out there is a possible loophole in the TPP for China to exploit.

More than half (51%) of U.S. Muslims polled also believe either that they should have the choice of American or shariah courts, or that they should have their own tribunals to apply shariah. Only 39% of those polled said that Muslims in the U.S. should be subject to American courts.

These notions were powerfully rejected by the broader population according to the Center’s earlier national survey.  It found by a margin of 92%-2% that Muslims should be subject to the same courts as other citizens, rather than have their own courts and tribunals here in the U.S.

Even more troubling, is the fact that nearly a quarter of the Muslims polled believed that, “It is legitimate to use violence to punish those who give offense to Islam by, for example, portraying the prophet Mohammed.”

By contrast, the broader survey found that a 63% majority of those sampled said that “the freedom to engage in expression that offends Muslims or anybody else is guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and cannot be restricted.”

Nearly one-fifth of Muslim respondents said that the use of violence in the United States is justified in order to make shariah the law of the land in this country.

&gt;In October 2011, a 2,200-page report, ""Banlieue de la République"" (Suburbs of the Republic) found that Seine-Saint-Denis and other Parisian suburbs are becoming ""separate Islamic societies"" cut off from the French state and where Islamic Sharia law is rapidly displacing French civil law.

&gt;The report also showed how the problem is being exacerbated by radical Muslim preachers who are promoting the social marginalization of Muslim immigrants in order to create a parallel Muslim society in France that is ruled by Sharia law.

&gt;The television presenter asks: ""What if we went to the suburbs?"" Obertone replies: ""I do not recommend this. Not even we French dare go there anymore. But nobody talks about this in public, of course. Nor do those who claim, 'long live multiculturalism,' and 'Paris is wonderful!' dare enter the suburbs.""

In the UK It's not that the police are scared to enter some areas, it's that they they don't called to them because residents prefer to administer their own justice. 

Chief Inspector of Constabulary Tom Winsor said police officers were simply never called to some neighbourhoods.

He said: ‘There are some communities born under other skies who will not involve the police at all. I am reluctant to name the communities in question, but there are communities from other cultures who would prefer to police themselves.

‘There are cities in the Midlands where the police never go because they are never called. They never hear of any trouble because the community deals with that on its own.

‘It’s not that the police are afraid to go into these areas or don’t want to go into those areas,’ he said. ‘But if the police don’t get calls for help then, of course, they won’t know what’s going on.’

Honour killings, domestic violence, sexual abuse of children and female genital mutilations are some of the offences that are believed to be unreported in some cities.

2) Muslims don't dislike the West. You're generalizing, again, for 1.6 billion people. I'm not sure you've ever even met a Muslim in your life now.


Look, no one wants terrorists in their country. Not Americans, Syrians, or French. Everyone hates them, especially the refugees who just had their lives destroyed in a senseless war where religious maniacs are literally trying to trigger the apocalypse. 


If you wish to condemn said refugees to death to protect yourself from the chance of a terrorist attack (which we have failed to prevent anyway even with negligible refugees entering this country), you are letting the terrorists win.

&gt;None of the attackers were refugees though... They were already in France and Belgium from before. (Edit: Actually, my bad, one of the nine entered the EU as a refugee. The others were already living in Europe previously).

The other nine were second generation refugees and from the Middle East, so if they hadn't let in Muslims those 100 people would still be alive.

&gt;Muslims don't dislike the West. You're generalizing, again, for 1.6 billion people. I'm not sure you've ever even met a Muslim in your life now.

Wrong the basic tenets of Islam undermine basic civil liberties and the majority of Muslims in the world support Sharia law in use so if you support honor killings, female genital mutilation, stoning of homosexuals, forced hajib wearing for women, etc then go nuts but that's not what the West stands for.


&gt;When fear overrules empathy we cannot claim to be civilized and much less ""leaders of the free world.""

Jesus Christ are you in the seventh grade? I've been to Egypt and we are more civilized in the ghettos of Chicago then in the best parts of that country and don't give me that bullshit about ""price of our freedom"" give me a fucking break what if a family member of yours was killed by Muslims would you still believe in your principles or would you want a loved one back? At the end of the day these people don't want freedom shown time and time again in their support of dictators like Qaddafi, Saddam Hussein, the Ayatollah, and now Assad.

So you're fine with tourism. Goods are not people, but they obviously don't magically pop up on the American side of the border, they are being transported into the country by people from all around the world.

&gt;Jersey City

A report of a swarm isn't the same thing as ""Thousands and thousands"" of celebrants - which is what Trump claimed.  Trump also said he saw it on TV.  I don't know why you won't admit the obvious point that witnessing thousands and thousands of Muslims celebrating the 9/11 attacks is different from hearing on the news that eight to twelve men had been arrested in conjunction with a swarm of suspects allegedly celebrating the attacks on a roof.

That admission is what I'd like to hear from Trump as well.  That he was wrong, that once he saw more evidence and arguments he updated his beliefs.  That seems like a reasonable thing to do to me.  I can understand getting confused, hearing about some people celebrating in Jersey, hearing about thousands celebrating at other countries, and over the years the stories blend together and your memory thinks maybe you did see thousands of people celebrating in Jersey.  What I can't understand is refusing to admit when you are wrong, when you can't produce the video you thought you saw, when all the other evidence suggests that it was a few people at most, why not admit you were wrong?  Why double down on it?    ",1449637890,cxsia03

The last week I was there I got to watch a gang of ""desperate"" refugees beat the piss out of a poor drunk German guy just for fun, it's nice that the locals are being so accommodating!  There are neighborhoods now where you'll see more women in burkas than women without.

That's how quickly everything is going to shit, Munich actually developed ""wrong"" neighborhoods on an observable timescale and I think that really says it all.  8 centuries of progress, rolled back in some places in a span of weeks.  What ultimately drove me to leave was that I was being paid less money than they were getting for free, and that's not even including free housing.  Eventually when it came time to renew my work visa it didn't seem worth the effort.  I don't see the point in living in a country where my skills and desire to actually integrate aren't appreciated, where I could just as easily burn my passport and drain the welfare system loitering outside of the brothels all day near Hauptbahnhof as a ""refugee"" while everybody else is working 9-5.

If this is what qualifies as ""successful integration"", the United States should opt out while they still have the chance.  There were very few people I spoke to firsthand in Germany that didn't seriously regret allowing these cultist vultures to colonize their country and slowly poison everything with violent mediocrity, and watching people in the United States make the same idiotic and naive arguments that people in Germany were making before things took a serious turn for the worse is almost like being in Groundhog Day.  These people have no idea what they're in for, assuming that they live anywhere near the places that will be affected. ",1449644626,cxsl0z6

In a poll taken earlier this month I can link you, 25% of respondents(American Muslims) said violence against Americans with the goal of implementing Sharia law here is okay. Do you think that's okay? People say oh yeah but what about Christian terrorists? We all condemn Christian terrorists. I guarantee you 99.999% of people in America condemn groups like KKK and westboro Baptist church. We also condemn attacks in the name of our religion. We shun them. And also, I dont know any Christians who want to bring all the laws written in the Bible to our country, especially with our bible having stoning and stuff. We dont. But they are okay with it. And so, we need to stop letting in new people who may want to or advocate harming our country until we can figure out what the problem is as a community. We are under attack by radical Islam, and just like FDR halted immigration of Japanese, Germans, Italians, as well as curbing their rights during WWII, we need to take some less draconian but necessary measures to protect America while we fight this war. I love Muslims. I have very good friends who are Muslims. But fuck man, this is too crazy, we can't ignore this issue anymore and just keep letting all these people who don't like us in. If you don't like America and thinks Americans should die you shouldn't be able to come to this country, and right now we can't tell Muslims who do from Muslims who don't, but we do know is that a HUGE number of them do. Watch this video to see just how much they support the Sharia and draconian punishments and shit. Trump is only trying to protect us, all americans. Not just whites. Not just rich people.

Besides that, I went through these and acknowledge a lot of these points but I'd like to point out they are slightly skewed. It has to do with what we consider a terrorist attack or not, and our law enforcement often does not like declaring things terrorist attacks often, it's bad. Just look at the shooting last week, Obama mentioned at one point that it was probably just a bad case of workplace violence. It wasn't. It was terrorism. Now, Muslims are great people and as it says there are many different interpretations to the Quran, but still, an overwhelming amount of Muslim Americans still support the violence against us to achieve Sharia, this just says they disagree with what Sharia entails (ie do we stone homosexuals and adulterers like the Sharia says or do we just mutlilate or imprison them?)

Yes, it's true that we have had many great Muslim service members and I respect their services and those who died as much as I respect any veteran for their sacrifice, and I also acknowledge that we've had some Muslim communities come together and help us solve cases of terrorism. But this doesn't change the fact. There are a lot of these people out there who seek to do harm to our country, but the problem in our country isn't nearly as bad as the rest of the world. Yes, we have homegrown Islamic terrorists, but the big issue with our Muslim communities is their unwillingness to condemn them. Many don't. As it says in the poll I mentioned, 25% support the violence, and that's 25% too much. They aren't condemning it. Some may celebrate it, God forbid. But it's a more manageable issue. Muslims in other countries like Pakistan, Syria, Iraq, etc will tell you a different narrative though. These people love killing Americans. They hate us. And many Muslims in even western European countries hate us too (that video I sent is from Norway). And so, in order to protect ourselves from further attack, I think it's best for now to stop letting them in. It's a tough solution, but it's better than letting someone in and then seeing the results of an attack.",1449647574,cxslzhq

Verse 8:12 *I will cast terror into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Therefore strike off their heads and strike off every fingertip of them.*

Trump does not want to suppress the Muslims who are here in our country and who are citizens and who are doing all the right things. He loves them. I've been at one of his rallies and I met a pair of Muslims and nothing bad happened to them. He has many Muslim friends and highly respects the religion. He just has a problem with radicals. And as of right now, we're under attack by them. ISIS is infiltrating this country as well as our European counterparts. Just the other day, Norway, extremely strained by all the Muslim refugees, offered Muslims thousands of dollars and a one way ticket home if they left. Sweden is spinning out of control, shooting up to the second largest rate of rape in the entire world, with statistics showing that most cases are Muslim immigrants raping Swedish women. It's absolutely insane. In America, our Muslim population isn't as bad, but according to a poll earlier this month, 25% of them support violence against Americans in order to fulfill Sharia law. And I'm sure a significantly higher percentage are part of that group that though they don't like something, won't stand up against it.So we have this problem with homegrown terror, and we need to educate our people and have a better community to fix that, fine. Trump never said to deport our Muslim citizens or not let them in. He wants to temporarily block Muslim immigration though. And it makes sense. If 25% of American Muslims don't mind violence against us to achieve Sharia, imagine the proportions of Muslims in other countries that hate us who would love to harm us. It's a lot. Take a poll in Pakistan and you'd find the majority would love to murder us. We can't let people who hate our country in. And some of these people you can't even give a proper background check to, as evidenced by the San Bernardino shooter, who was given a visa despite obviously being a radical. And so we need to stop the immigration and find out what's going on. It will be temporary. But we can't keep letting people in who want to kill us. That's not American. That's not American ideals. That's not against anything. That is protecting ourselves. If a specific group of people overwhelmingly wants to kill us, we need to do something about it. FDR stopped immigration from Italy, Japan, and Germany after Pearl Harbor. He curbed the rights of German and Italian Americans and he threw the Japanese into camps. What these terrorists are doing is much worse than the japanese, they're attacking civilians. And we aren't going to put Muslims in camps because we aren't like that anymore, but we do need to take some action. ",1449648328,cxsm7q5

What about those Muslims? They are Americans and good in my book. We just had a Muslim come on this sub and ask questions yesterday and we all accepted him. He's welcome to give me a hug any time. Trump's policy points have no bearing on non-radical Muslims, only radical Muslims. He's gonna watch some mosques that might have terrorism spreading and if they don't have it they'll move on. That's fine. The Muslim who came to this reddit said that is fine. Other than that normal Muslims won't be in this fray at all. And we need to deal with this in absolute terms until we can get a good vetting process that roots out these radicals and a cooperative Muslim community who will help us find any who slip by. This requires figuring things out in America, with all americans at the table. When considering immigrants, we don't need to take immigrants at all. Taking them is a privilege and if they hate America and want to kill us they don't deserve to be there. An overwhelming amount of Muslims in other countries want to kill us. And so we need to figure it out. We need to stop the Syria crisis. We need to open a dialogue with our Muslim community. We need to acknowledge the problem. Then we can let them in again. It's necessary for now. I say this with a heavy heart. We need to protect our nation. The problem is coming from this specific group of people and we can't ignore it anymore, you know? Say it's prejudiced all you want but it's a fact. It's not Christian immigrants doing it, it's not even illegals from Mexico doing it, it's these Muslim immigrants. And we need to figure it out and do something before it gets to the point where ISIS is fully established here and our people turn against muslims entirely. I'd hate to see that happen. I love them and have many Muslim friends. We need to take this problem at the roots. Overwhelming majority(99.9999%) condemn KKK and we all universally condemn any Christian who does an attack.

(See I.N.A. Section 313.)
The law similarly blocks naturalization for anyone who within the last ten years, individually or as part of any organization, advocates or teaches the forceful or violent overthrow of the U.S. government, assaults or murders any government officer, damages, injures, or destroys property, or commits sabotage.

- Kill homosexuals

- Kill anyone who doesn't believe in the Abrahamic God (gee, sure sounds similar to the link you provided)

- Kill women who have premarital sex

- Kill anybody who works on Sunday


Also, do you think the I.N.A. stance on communism, which was put forth in the 1950's as a response to the Cold War and hasn't been amended since, is Constitutional?

You have provided no solid argument for your cause, while I have provided many arguments against it and backed it up with cited sources.

8081,chillenchillada,"2 months I would have been just like you, horrified by this and seeing how plainly it contradicts every American principle. But after Paris, after San Bernardino... I wouldn't say I support the proposal, but I understand the place it comes from. I'm not a Trump supporter (I consider him insufficiently conservative; I support Rand Paul and Ted Cruz), I just come here for the lulz and libtears. But I saw an excellent point brought up here yesterday on this:

America STILL bans anyone affiliated, currently or previously, with a Communist Party from entering America.

Why would this be? Well, the people who came up with it understood that Communism is an ideology diametrically opposed to American liberty. It is a philosophy which turns our enemies against us. Although there may be good, America-loving Communists (like Barnie Sandlers), generally most of them will act against our national interests, and we are safer and freer for keeping them out.

Again, 2 months ago I would tell you Islam is a wonderful, peaceful Abrahamic religion. As a Christian, they are my misguided cousins in love of the One God. But now we see that there are real threats among their ranks. And with San Bernardino, we see that it is NOT that easy to tell the good from the bad. And we know that any Muslim might become radicalized, especially those with links back to the middle east.

Think about your perception of a terrorist: Is he like the Muslims you might know, who eat pork, drink liberally, go clubbing, espouse Western styles, and couldn't tell you the location of the nearest mosque? Or is he the most rabid, devout, precise practitioner of all his religion teaches? It seems that the more violent the Muslim, the more strongly he upholds his religion. It appears to me that there may be something in that religion which motivates such violence. (And if you consider acts of violence committed by Christians, while many Christian terrorists ARE particularly devout, consider that there is little in the teachings of Jesus nor anywhere else in scripture COMMANDING believers - in a prescriptive, NOT descriptive sense - towards acts of violence. It's a plain reading. Christian doctrine is accidental to the bulk of their acts of hatred, which arguably is the difference between Christianity and Islam.)

Right now I'd say this is a foolhardy, unserious proposal. But I'm also hearing little better from anyone else. So at the very least, I'm impressed by Trump's willingness to explore whether the issue lies in Islam itself, and to consider that, just as in the Cold War Communism was a threat to us, today Islam may be the threat we face.

The fact the Supreme Court creates laws with their interpretation is the problem. Again.  None of the cases you mentioned are applicable to this situation.  So what I think of the court is irrelevant. (and it is well known they overstep the limits of their power). 


The issue of whites Vs black was an issue of superiority,  white people though blacks were inferior. These people were equal under the law(mostly). This issue has to do with national security and allowing aliens to come into the country.  The two are not comparable on any level. Aliens are not equal to American citizens under American law

You try to make this about racism or bigotry and it's not.  It's about logical reasoning. 

1. We have no obligation to let anyone in. 
2. The people we do let in should represent a clear benefit to the US. 
3. Many Muslim immigrants come from areas where they are indoctrinated to hate us. 
= we should be especially critical when letting in Muslim's as they are more likely to not only not benefit the country,  but be harmful. 

Let's not forget we know terrorists are trying to get into this country as both immigrants and refugees.

As I said.  You fail to realize the purpose of both the government and immigration. It's to protect and increase the welfare of the citizens.

Again, read the articles I provided and you'll see MULTIPLE cases of terrorist acts caused by both muslim, christian and jewish extremists. 

The report shows that there are islamic extremists in there but also christian/jewish/Latino extremist that commit acts of terror.

The fact of the matter is that after 9/11 only 73 terrorist deaths came from muslim extremists while the mass shootings that we are so accustomed to came from other radical groups of christians.

""The mayor of Philadelphia called Donald J. Trump an “a—hole” Tuesday for proposing a ban on all Muslims entering the U.S.

Mayor Michael Nutter’s comment came at a press conference where he and other city officials were calling for tolerance and understanding, a day after a severed pig’s head was found outside a city mosque.

“He’s an a—hole. How can I take seriously foreign policy from someone like that?” Mr. Nutter said of the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination. Then, recognizing that he uttered the expletive in front of about 40 faith leaders, including priests and an imam, the mayor said, “I apologize.”

Mr. Trump is scheduled to speak at a GOP fundraiser Friday during the annual Pennsylvania Society weekend in New York City, and the mayor called on state Republicans to disinvite him from the event.

Mr. Nutter said Mr. Trump was using the “playbook of Hitler” and trying to “radicalize Americans against Muslims,” according to BillyPenn.com.

Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey said police are analyzing security video footage of a pickup truck leaving the pig’s head, and that police are closely watching mosques in the city.""",1449677955,cxsxfpc

Check out the wikipedia articles for [The Bible and violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bible_and_violence) and [The Quran and violence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran_and_violence).

I don't think a marginal difference in violence is a fair description.

Jesus' stance on violence couldn't be more clear in the Bible

&gt; Ephesians 4:32 – ""Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you"".

&gt;Luke 6:27 – “But I say to you who hear, Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you"".

&gt;Matthew 5:43-48 – “You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?"".

&gt;Matthew 26:52 ""But Jesus said to him, “Put your sword in its place, for all who take the sword will perish by the sword"". (Jesus said this after Peter had struck one of the soldiers who were attempting to arrest Jesus. Jesus subsequently healed the soldier's wound).

&gt;Romans 12:17-21 ""Do not repay anyone evil for evil. Be careful to do what is right in the eyes of everybody. If it is possible, as far as it depends on you, live at peace with everyone"".

&gt;1 Peter 3:9 ""Do not repay evil with evil or insult with insult, but with blessing, because to this you were called so that you may inherit a blessing"".

&gt;1 John 2:9-10 ""Anyone who claims to be in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness. Whoever loves his brother lives in the light, and there is nothing in him to make him stumble"".

In contrast, the Quran is just a user guide for war.

I also don't think it is fair to say the actions of the Catholic church a thousand years ago have anything to do with the Bible. Back then, people did not have access to the scriptures of the Bible themselves (before printing press), They relied on the priests to read and interpret these things. The Catholic Church abused this power and misrepresented the scriptures with impunity. This could not occur today, as everyone as open access to read and interpret the true scriptures for themselves.",1449680984,cxszmfc

Pah. No. Cuck leftists might welcome other cultures, but I'm afraid that leftists are the vocal minority. The large majority of people don't want to integrate and embrace other cultures. If a European wants to experience Muslim culture, they should be able to choose to experience it, not be forced to experience it. 

And please, tell me about all those historical events where foreign cultures successfully integrated together. Oh wait. You can't. Because cultures aren't supposed to integrate. People don't want to integrate with people from other cultures. 

&gt;It appears you're from Germany, what the hell would you even know about whats going on in different parts of society?

Really? You're saying Germans have no idea about society and integration? In case you haven't seen, Angela Merkel is happily letting the whole Middle East migrate to Germany freely. If any nationality has the right to speak up against immigrants, it's the Germans. 

I just think it's a complete disgrace how Muslims feel that they have the right to invade whichever country they feel like invading and force their culture upon the natives of said country. It's like you're insecure about Islam and you want other people to convert to Islam and enjoy Islamic culture to make you feel better. 

It's a sad time we live in when Europeans are being called racist and treated like scum in their own countries because they refuse to embrace a foreign invasion. 

Just look at the UK. Look at the start of Queen Elizabeth II's reign and compare it to now. When she took over in 1952, the UK was a white, Christian country. Everyone got along with each other, and the British people were happily, voluntarily working together to rebuild a country damaged by World War II. 

This is when it all started. The British government noticed the shortage of workers available due to the millions of men who died in the war, so they thought ""How about we get workers from the Caribbean? It'll only be temporary until the British population is back to how it was."" 

63 years later and here we are. It's incredible to think how letting in small numbers of workers from the Caribbean (who, might I add, are the kind of immigrants we need - people who come here for the sole purpose of working and contributing to making this country better) has evolved to letting a foreign religion (Islam) take over our country. 

The petition to ban Donald Trump from the UK has made me ashamed to be British. A man who is literally protecting his country from a religion that wants to destroy the USA is seen as a ""hate preacher"", and is being compared to Islamic hate preachers who encourage the murder of British soldiers, and wish to make the UK an Islamic Caliphate. 

That's right, a man who wants to protect his country is being compared to people who want to destroy a country.

-Rip the Quran in front of them and spit on it and stomp on it. If they react to it angrily then they might be muslims. Repeat this about a dozen times if they don't get initially angry the first time.

-Put a dog out in front of them and ask them to touch it. If they're scared of it and refuse to touch it, it's possible that they're muslims.

-Ask if they support sharia law. If they do, then they're most likely muslims.

* Scared to touch dogs? Must be a Muslim.

* Don't believe women should wear provocative clothing or have equal rights? There goes a large portion of fundamentalist Christians/Amish/Jewish populations.

There isn't a test that you listed that isn't completely flawed. Some of these even show how little exposure to Muslims you have (e.g. dog touching, wtf?)

Even if these tests were Muslim-specific, how would you measure someone getting angry? Heartbeat? There's no way that could be used to deny immigration rights. Nor could you for simply suspecting somebody is ""possibly Muslim"".

Obamacare guaranteed insurance companies customers they otherwise wouldn't have had.  And they have behaved poorly because *we're not allowed to not have insurance*.  Sounds like he means to set up a ***REAL*** single payer system like every other western industrialized country.

And this same nefarious plot included some sort of disruption of the wedding day itself. And there was this other nefarious plot to tap his phones. Perot had no proof that either plot existed, but hey, a man can't be too careful with his daughter's happiness, now can he? ^(**Note: It was later discovered that the man who told Perot about the plots actually made it up in an effort to discredit Bush.**) 

&gt; ## So please tell me why you think none of this matters to you? I am not trying to cause problems, I am trying to understand.

First, let me ask you -- is a stupid plan that works, really all that stupid?

Donald Trump is positively dominating the news cycle.  He's raising people's emotions -- often in anger.  But you see, when the rubber hits the road emotion is emotion.  A scary movie *shouldn't* make you more attracted to your date -- *but it does*.  Because emotion is emotion.

Doesn't much matter which emotion it is.

So he's dominating the thoughts of even the people who are against him.  Imagine how elated a marketing company would be if they could generate so much buzz for their clients!

And by the time the election rolls around, he will have softened his stance on almost everything (you'd know that if you had read [**The Art of the Deal**](http://www.amazon.com/Donald-J-Trump-First-Hardcover/dp/B00RWQD3DG/ref=sr_1_4?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1449706417&amp;sr=1-4&amp;keywords=the+art+of+the+deal)\) -- and everybody's memories will have mellowed -- and the whole time between then and now, he'll have ***DOMINATED*** the news cycle.

That's why.  ",1449706625,cxthxgj

Have you not seen how angry they usually get over images of their beloved prophet? Charlie Hebdo incident ring a bell?

Some of these tests are pretty valid. The point however is to make it all add up instead of relying on a single one. If they fail over a good 50% of it, the safest bet is to assume they're a muslim and to keep them from immigrating into the US.

Really though, it'd be less of a trouble if the ban was regional anyway instead of it being religious. You kinda prove why it should be that way since this'd be a load of crap to go through.

I always love data :D

As for your post I don't quite understand your message to me.
You agree with me in identifying the problem with ISIS. But the only answer you seem to be providing to the problem is what we have been using for the past eight years: Give condolences to the Muslim community, sweep up the rubble from the attack, and pull a media blitz for ""Don't give in to hate!""

This does not work for two reasons:
1. By pulling a media blitz and clamping down on the public you create a censored spot light that doesn't allow for anything considered unorthodox. This creates a bubble in the public of people who oppose the media's anti-hate narrative. These people will never get to go onto the public stage for fear of being crucified by MSM and will steadily grow in numbers outside of the fourth estate until the bubble pops in a rude and sudden manner (see Ex. A: Donald J Trump)

2. This can handicap the public handling the problem by setting a president of political correctness for the public. This can have very detrimental affect on preventing terrorism. IMO the San Bernardino shooting was possible in part from Political Correctness.
Here's a link. I think it drives the point home well:http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/427960/san-bernardino-shows-high-cost-political-correctness-david-french

As the great Winston Churchill said: Americans will always do what's right... After they've tried everything else.

If you have any New ideas on how to solve this problem I'd love to take it up and try to play it out in my head.

Trump is only talking about terrorism, but that's just the surface. If Sharia law is made the law of our lands, do you know exactly what will happen? Women's rights?

You know what I think of them? They're fine as long as they don't wanna kill any non-muslims and **keep out** of western countries. That's the way it should be. If **1.1 billion** muslims want sharia law to rule, it stands to reason that a large majority of muslims wanting to immigrant over here, probably want to institute Sharia law into our countries.

8759,trailrunner11,"Exactly. Trump doesn't want to halt immigration because they believe in Allah, or because they don't celebrate Christmas.  It's because they have political ideologies that are a direct threat to the security of our nation.  One could argue that there is a blurred line between political ideology and religion in all cases, but the ideologies of Buddhists don't typically pose a threat to nation states.

A religion is defined as a an organized collection of beliefs, cultural systems, and world views that relate humanity to an order of existence.  Based on this definition, communism is a religion.  Religion and culture are intertwined, and laws are a result of culture.  A majority of Muslims have a worldview and culture that is incompatible with our Constitution, just like communists do. 

Muslims don't have this same separation of Church and State that we have.  They preach about politics and law constantly.  Something that if you were to do here in a Christian Church, you would, and rightfully so, have your religious tax exempt status revoked.  Therefore, even by our own standards, they're part religion, part political group.  

My final point is that our Freedom of Religion defends the religious freedom of people who are on US soil.  Preventing them from coming here does not infringe on their right to practice their religion, because they can still practice it, just not here.  

Stating that Trump's proposed policy violates the Constitution is blatantly false.

How would we prevent them from entering, considering there isn't any religious registry in that country that I'm aware of? Or India, with 13.4% of its population being Muslim (again, Google's numbers)?

Would non-Islamic countries that have presented somewhat realistic concerns be included, such as France and Belgium (which the majority of the Paris attackers were citizens of)?

We need to support integrating refugees while imposing more stringent filtering methods to catch the fundamentalists.  

Also, I appreciate your statistic, but 43% is what I consider to be rather low. It sounds more like 57% hold sharia above national or international law, which is ridiculously high.

I'm sure if you asked an Amish person if everyone should embrace their way of life they would say yes. Sharia Law may disgust you (and me) with it's social views, but lots of these views (gay rights, women's rights) are similar to other religions and fundamentalist Christian/Jewish groups as well. 

Its absurd to think that Muslims could ever overthrow a western legal system and impose Sharia Law. That's paranoia right there.

8859,sparrow4,"I remember how horrified I was when I read the Wikipedia article about the Rotherham child rape scandal.

&gt;In 2010, five men of Pakistani heritage were found guilty of a series of sexual offences against girls as young as twelve... 1,400 children had been sexually abused in the town between 1997 and 2013, predominantly by gangs of British-Pakistani men... it had been covered up for fear of ""giving oxygen"" to racism.

Then I scrolled down to the bottom, to the ""Related articles"" section... 

&gt;**Rochdale sex trafficking gang**: ""The men were all British Pakistanis (except for one from Afghanistan) and from Muslim backgrounds, and the girls were White; this led to national discussion of whether the crimes were racially motivated, or, conversely, whether the failure to investigate them was linked to the authorities' fear of being accused of racism.""

&gt;**Derby sex gang**: ""The gang of thirteen men, most of whom were from Pakistani backgrounds... They were considered devout Muslims and family-orientated men.""

&gt;**Oxford sex gang**: ""As in the similar Rochdale, Rotherham, Derby and Telford prosecutions, all gang members were from Muslim backgrounds, and the girls were white.""

&gt;**Bristol sex gang**: ""a large group of Somali men who committed serious sexual offences against underage teenage girls... the abused girls were almost all white and the gang were of Muslim heritage.""

&gt;**Telford sex gang**: ""a group of seven men of Pakistani descent who preyed extensively on pre-teen and under-age teenage girls in Telford, England... There were accounts concerning men who would ejaculate and then urinate in children's mouths, violating them in every orifice, as well as gang-rape by queues of men while girls were held hostage for hours, sometimes days – all the while being forced to listen to the screams of girls in other rooms with other men.""

&gt;**Peterborough sex abuse case**: ""The men, who were of Pakistani, Iraqi Kurdish and Slovak Roma heritage... the victims were typically vulnerable white girls... Some were subsequently trafficked as child prostitutes.""

&gt;**Banbury sex gang**: ""The men were named as Ahmed Hassan-Sule AKA Fiddy Baby, 21, Kagiso Manase, 20, Takudzwa Hova, 21, Mohamed Saleh, 21, Said Saleh, 20, Alexandru Nae, 19, Zsolt Szaltoni, 18.""

&gt;**Aylesbury sex gang**: ""During the trial they required the services of Hindi, Urdu, Pashto and Punjabi interpreters... He said he could not explain why the criminals ""focused their attention on white under-age girls"", but believed their ""vulnerability"" played a major role. He claimed that if the criminals had targeted ""Asian under-age girls, they would have paid a heavy price in their community.""

Your link on gun control is ridiculous.

Even the EPA stated in its cost/benefits analysis that if we undertook every single plan, cut and tax they propose, we *might* reduce temperature by a fraction of a degree over the course of two decades.    

There is no tenable solution to climate change proposed. Just ""Keep giving us money or we're all going to die! ~~Buy~~ Act now!""

That said, even the worst IPCC reports do not entail extinction, as the media is fond of pushing. At worst:  

More severe and frequent weather events: (Storms, heatwaves, etc) 

Increased sea level rise: Potentially swamping some islands and shorelines.  

Increased drought: Implicating worse harvests.  

To date: [SLR has remained around 3.3 per century](http://sealevel.colorado.edu/) , [drought % has not increased globally](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015EA000100/abstract?campaign=woletoc)  and [extreme weather frequency/severity is steady or down in some cases.](http://wattsupwiththat.com/reference-pages/climatic-phenomena-pages/extreme-weather-page/)...  

Anything problems in the world implied to be caused by these is conflating weather events with the climate, which changes quite a bit naturally and generally continues much as it has for the last few billion years.

Ok you are entitled to that thought process, but I like to look at people's actions and if they are inconsistent, i ask why. For instance,  you do know that Trump gave a LOT of money to PUT Nancy Pelosi in power. She wasn't a winner until he made her a winner. That does not make you ask a question of why? Maybe because he'd get something in return? So when he's doing the buying you don't have a problem, but you tout the fact that he can't be bought? Like he doesn't subscribe to that type of politics. How do you know? He's never been in office...but in his personal life he's certainly participated in this type of politics. 

2) Why are you jumping to extremes on guns? I never said Trump is a gun grabber. What i said is that Trump's view on gun has changed and along with the list of other things I mentioned. This amount of change (esp. changing party affiliations as many times as he has) SHOULD lead his supporters and detractors to simply raise the question of what we should and should not believe.

3) I am not trying to stop Trump. I'm trying to understand him and his supporters. See, I like to learn about things that seem foreign to me. Instead of running from them, or closing the borders to them, I like to understand them so I can strengthen my belief system and see point of views that may have been hidden by my race, culture or upbringing.

Respect to those who answered with well thought through responses. You've shown that you have real, foundational reasons that you support Trump and you've changed my mind a bit about WHY someone would follow him. Thank you.

To those like allinfortrump, I hope conversations like these will encourage you to peel a level deeper into why you believe what you believe. I came in peace to ask some questions. Some answered respectfully and are confident in why they support Donald Trump. Others, like yourself, attacked me for questioning you. To me, that is a sign of weakness or a lack of confidence in your foundational understanding of your own belief system.

[Nope, not particularly unprecidented.](http://phys.org/news/2015-11-ancient-climate-underestimated.html?utm_source=menu&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=item-menu) Also consider the last inter glacial at it's peak had little to no ice on the poles, 20 feet higher ocean (or was it meters?) and only 200 ppm of carbon.   

Modern instrumental record only goes back about 50 years and proxies aren't perfect, but we can determine what we're experiencing is likely not unprecedented. 

&gt;However, the increased temperatures can influence weather patterns leading to droughts in other areas of the world including in Syria and here at home.  

Good thing there's been negligible atmospheric warming for near two decades now, much less anything correlating to carbon. GHG theory would indicate warming atmosphere before surface with the exception of the tropics, which has not been the case.

The scientific community agrees that climate change is real and is man made, but to what degree and the specifics of the amount of carbon emission are still being debated. And they still agree that we have to act in terms of changing our fossil fuel addiction. However it is fact that Carbon Dioxide does increase temperatures. I've actually did an experiment on this for fun. You can take two glass jar, both with a ball in it, a heating lamp on top of it at equal distance, and a thermometer. But in one jar, you put a tube that connects to a carbon emitter (for example, an automobile), and you'll see in time that the one jar with Co2 in it is increasing in temperature while the temperature in the other jar remains the same. 

The thing is that in China and India, there is no debate within their government about the science of climate change. They're taking action into solving the environmental problems they face with in their communities. The levels of smog in their cities have reached dangerous levels where it can leave these cities uninhabitable. Also too you see third world communities in Southeast Asian countries having their homes displaced because of the rise in sea level as well as well as severe storms that are becoming increasingly common. 

Also too, you have to think about how fast our ice is melting around the arctic, which is important not only to protect the wildlife that exists there, the ice also reflects solar radiation. That amount of ice has drastically decreased over the past decades which mostly has to do with the increased temperatures over the years. 

Think about this for a second. Would you rather take a course of action that would not only remove our fossil fuel addiction, but also give us a chance to leave a habitable environment for future generations, OR would you rather we continue the route that we are taking now and take a mighty risk in leaving our planet uninhabitable.

Climate change =/= anthropogenic Climate change. 
And indeed, quite a bit of debate on other subjects pertaining to it.

[Global Climatologist survey 1996-2003](https://www.heartland.org/sites/all/modules/custom/heartland_migration/files/pdfs/20861.pdf)  

The only difference between Meteorologists and Climatologists is the timeframes they tend to study. They use the same tools, techniques and methodologies.   

&gt;However it is fact that Carbon Dioxide does increase temperatures.  

In a closed environment, a simple experiment. Sure. In the open world I have already shown you we can demonstrate that carbon in itself does not cause the temperature of the planet to rise. There are many complex actions least of which is that higher concentrations of carbon fertilize increased plant growth.   

I seem to recall a certain proxy record of ferns which are now extinct due to lacking the levels of carbon needed to sustain them for instance.   

&gt;omes displaced because of the rise in sea level as well as well as severe storms that are becoming increasingly common.  

SLR has remained consistent, can't blame that on AGW. And as I indicated with data, storms are stable or even lower in frequency and strength.   

&gt;how fast our ice is melting around the arctic  

[Arctic is recovering](http://notrickszone.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Arctic_2015_12_seaice_anomaly_arctic-1024x832.png), along with record gains in the antarctic. It's certainly not accelerating in loss. Several sources indicate the polar bears are fine (population increasing) though they might suffer in the spring due to *thicker* ice causing problems rather than a lacktherof.   
  

&gt;OR would you rather we continue the route that we are taking now and take a mighty risk in leaving our planet uninhabitable.  

Ah yes, the ultimatum. Consider this: Would you pay me 200 bucks to remove possible viruses that may or may not exist on your computer?  
I'm sure your computer may have been a little slow recently, perhaps a fraction of a second longer than previously loading a window, or booting up?   

It could be malicious hardware. But for the low price of $200 bucks and a few days, I can possibly fix a problem that may or may not exist. At worst, you're only out 200 bucks, right?  

Or alternatively, why not give me your car keys? You could get into a fatal accident one day, the chances are rather high! Rather than running the disk of death or dismemberment, I can help make you safer by taking that car off your hands!   

----------------  

Not perfect examples by any means of course, but you understand the idea here.  

Consider the absolute worst nuclear catastrophy in history, chernobyl. Radiation that threatened to sweep across the world and turn entire nations into inhabitable wastelands!   

Except it didn't. In fact, if anything Chernobyl has become something of a nature preserve. Life has flourished and some people are even returning to begin working again in the region.   

Consider Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Short of all out nuclear war, there is little *lasting* damage we can do to the habitat that is earth. Given a few decades it could be as though we never were.   

**Consider again, the non-solutions provided by those who are peddling fear.** Possibly a few fractions of a degree in reduction over the course of two decades at the cost of modern convenience (While others are allowed to pollute freely). Coming from people who own billion dollar homes on the sea front, travel in private jets and enjoy all the luxuries of society while proclaiming them to be disastrous and dangerous to our very being.    

Again, there's no reason we can't continue to develop sustainable and environmentally friendlier industry and living means. We certainly are and have been, a far cry from the 70's, for instance.

And ignoring that others exist will only let those groups get worse. In fact, most terrorism in the US and Europe is NOT committed by Islamic radicals. I don't want these type of attacks to happen more.

Secondly, I'm not sure if the source you used proves your point. All of those terrorist attacks on the list occurred in civil war areas (Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Cameroon/Niger area), so under your own dismissal, none of them should ""count"". But even if we look at them and the whole chart, we see that most terrorism didn't happen anywhere near the US, but instead near the group's home range. Additionally, while large amounts of terrorism happened in the Middle East, significant amounts of attacks happened in areas outside of this scope, like in Africa, East India, Columbia, and the Philippines. Obviously there is Islamic terrorism in those places, but there is also other terrorism there too. Why is this terrorism less important to prevent? Because my TV said so?

Finally, I appreciate you anticipating my motives for disagreeing with you, but I do not believe that I ever tried to apologize for terrorist organizations like ISIS. They are one of the vilest groups of people on this planet, and will hopefully die very horrible deaths. But I don't want Americans and other innocent people dying while we focus only on one threat, and I definitely don't want to trample people's rights and destroy this country's most basic values in exchange for chasing plans that are not solutions to the problem, and may actually make the situation worse.

Attention should be focused on the problems of the world, particularly stopping terrorism, but banning all Muslims from entering the US is not the right kind of attention. Just my opinion, and thank you for providing yours and your reasoning.",1449782892,cxukhw7

9016,[deleted],"I've tried to explain this on reddit, but any post that comes off as being anti-Islam gets downvoted to hell. I will explain to you guys how this religion came to be and why it's bad and maybe you can figure out how to explain this to people. Think of a religion like a meme. Like a crafted idea you plant in someone's mind to make them act a certain way. We've all learned a lot about the way Donald thinks by watching him craft his memes. I'm going to take you inside the mind of Mohammed, and then you'll understand Islam.

A few points before I start:

1) IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STORIES ARE TRUE OR NOT. ""I'm le reddit atheist and you're stupid with your magic sky fairies!"" doesn't stop the Islamist from beheading you.

2) Religion shapes culture which shapes the way people behave individually and in groups. Particularly when you have people in groups, they act far more like their group culture. Everybody gets churchier when you're at church regardless of what church it is.

3) It doesn't matter what bad things exist in other religions or what individual followers of any particular religion do. I'm talking about the basic moral philosophy of Islam and how it shapes their behavior.

4) It doesn't matter if ""not all of them think..."" because people feel differently about their religion at different points in their life. Today's whore is tomorrow's born again Bible thumper and today's ""quiet, peaceful muslim"" is tomorrow's aloha snackbar. Generally that takes an existential crisis, a ""what am I doing with my life?"" experience to make people find them some religion. And when that religion is Islam, you get snackbars.

5) Unfortunately I can't talk about Islam without talking about Christianity. If you're a le reddit atheist I know you hate it too. That's fine. Please hold the knee jerk ""BUT TEH CRUSADEZ!"" Also, understand that even if you hate Christianity, if you're a westerner, your culture is heavily influenced by Christianity. Your ideas of right and wrong are probably fairly Christian. Please put down the hate for Christians long enough to understand that Islam is way, way worse.

Okay, so understand the basic point of Christianity: humans are shit. Made from dirt. Go to dirt. But created in God's image! But then we chose to disobey him, and that's why the world is shit. But he loves us anyway. So much so that he sent his only son who taught us the *point* of the laws in the Old Testament: love God, love your neighbor. No violence. No killing. And to *prove* he loved us, he let himself be tortured and died horribly suffering every indignity and still forgave us so his character is unimpeachable. And he could do all of that without sinning because he was the perfect man, because he was God.

I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS TRUE OR NOT. THIS IS PART OF THE MEME THAT MOHAMMED HAD TO DESTROY.

So now 600-odd years later Mohammed wants power and money and rape victims and all that shit. So he decides to start a religion. Well, lots of people around were Christians and Jews so he thought ""oh, I'll copy their shit and change it and then they'll join me!""

Every few weeks there's a ""TIL Jesus is mentioned in the Qur'an more than Mohammed!"" Yes. True. Jesus is all through there. But it ain't the same dude. First thing Momo had to do was deny Christ's divinity. Christians believe there are no more prophets because, after all, if Jesus is God, what do you need Mohammed to say that Jesus didn't already say? So Momo says ""Hey guys, join *my* religion. And you can keep your Jesus! I know you like that guy. Great guy eh? But see, your texts were corrupted, Jesus was just a prophet. But still super cool and did magic! Oh, and still perfect! Never sinned! And, and get this, he did NOT die on the cross! That was just an illusion! He got raised up to heaven by Allah without dying and another dude got transmogrified in his place and he died! So, see, Jesus *won!* He beat his enemies when Allah **deceived** them into making them only *think* he died!""

Uh oh. That ain't right. Um, why do you think Christians would want that? What's Christ without the cross? Just a guy with good ideas who couldn't take the heat. So there's no love there. Also, a perfect man? Who *wasn't* God? 

Any of you guys ever met a perfect man? That doesn't sound right. Seems like bullshit to me.

And then Allah, who apparently is the same as the God of Abraham, *deceived* people? Oh shit. 

Any time you say ""there's tons of violent commands in the Qur'an"" the multiculturalists come out of the woodwork to say ""there's bad stuff in the bible too!"" Yes. Old testament, sure. But there's one thing Allah does that the Christian God never, ever ever did, and that's lie. He'd smite your ass, sure. But he never lied to you. There is no story that says ""and then God totally faked out the enemies of the Israelites..."" And you guys know about taqiya, the command of Allah to lie for him if it helps them spread Islam or whatever reason they can justify.

Uh oh. That basically makes Allah the ""father of lies."" That ain't God.

IT DOESN'T MATTER IF THE STORIES ARE TRUE OR NOT. If you've got people following a devil worshiper cult, it doesn't matter if the devil is real or not. They're still doing the things the devil would want them to do if the devil were real.

Christian philosophy is simple: love God. Love your neighbor. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. All the ""rules"" flow from that and can be derived. And changed and updated so long as they fit that basic principle, which is pretty good.

But Islam is a bunch of strict commandments. And they're all like ""don't kill. Unless you have a good reason!"" ""Don't lie. Unless you have a good reason!"" A lot of the excuses have to do with ""being persecuted."" Well, who can't claim to feel persecuted at some time or another? Basically in Islam the ends justify the means, so long as your intention (the spread of Islam) is ""good."" And we know where the road paved with good intentions leads. 

When Christians screw up and break the ""be nice"" rules to do things they think are good, they're being bad Christians. When Muslims do ""prohibited"" things ""but with a good reason,"" they're being good Muslims. A bad Christian is a good Muslim.

Islam is an evil ideology, like Nazism or racism. Like I said, in Christianity, you're shit made in the image of God. None are worthy, all have fallen short. Humility is a virtue, and pride is basically the worst sin. Pride made the devil the devil. Also, ""it's not what goes into a man which defiles him, it's what comes out of a man that defiles him."" So you're made shitty, and trying to be good, and shit you do that's bad is YOUR FAULT. This idea of personal responsibility permeates western civilization. When a man rapes a woman, we blame the man.

In Islam, you are not made in the image of Allah. You are just one of Allah's infinite creations. And you're made *pure*, and corruption comes from the world. That means when you do something wrong, not your fault! It's somebody else's fault! This is why when a man rapes a woman in a hardcore Islamic country they stone the woman because she tempted the pure muslim man with her brazen bare ankle.

There will never be an end to Islamic violence because in the Islamic world view, everything bad is somebody else's fault. Since there will be no end to problems in this world, there will be no end to Islamic violence, but the pure muslim man is always blameless. 

Now I said Islam is an *evil* ideology, like Nazism or racism. What makes Nazism and racism evil? Well, you start with a lie and a sin, and that sin is pride. ""You, aryan, are better than the lesser races, who have no human rights."" Once you take that as a given, there's no end to the horror because you can do anything you want to something subhuman. ""You, believer, are superior to the infidel, who has no human rights."" There's nothing like that in Christianity. Non-believers may get jacked up by God later, but they're always human. And when man has made institutions that set men above each other, like slavery, the abolitionists and the equal rights activists used Christian arguments to destroy those systems. 

Yes, I know, I know, some people used Christianity to do bad things. But Christianity rights itself and tends towards good. Islam does not. It ""rights"" itself back to pride, blame, and xenocide. It is qualitatively different than Christianity. It is the exact opposite of Christianity. 

DON'T CARE IF THE STORIES ARE TRUE OR NOT. But as long as people are reading the Qur'an, there will always be brutal Islamic violence.",1449785309,cxum6oy

9076,Gorech1ld,"&gt;Its absurd to think that Muslims could ever overthrow a western legal system and impose Sharia Law. That's paranoia right there.

It is absolutely not.

Do you understand the birth rates among the muslim communities? In comparison to the native populations of many countries, the muslim communities have many children at a high rate.

Now, in the US, since their population is low, it's unlikely this will happen, but in Europe, in countries such as Germany and Sweden, the muslim's populations are expanding at a rapid pace. And a lot of you will still say that I'm paranoid but if absolutely nothing is done to even slow down the muslims birth rates and the declining birth rates of the natives? Well, then eventually... Hmm.. What happens? Tch, wow, I can't seem to put my finger o- OH! That's right, the muslims become the FUCKING. MAJORITY.

And do you know what'll likely happen if they become the majority? Well, the minority will have no choice but to submit to them in the face of them asking for sharia law. I mean, it makes sense to ask for it right? The people that want it are the majority, and the minority only listens to their demands anyway, because otherwise they'd be accused of racism anyway.

&gt;And what defines getting their shit together in the Middle East? Until they no longer experience acts of terrorism?

What the fuck kind of question this is? I'm not calling you stupid, but really? Do I have to fucking answer this shit?

How about we wait until they fucking achieve secularism? Fucking separation of the goddamn church and state. The way they run their countries, their religion takes precedence over everything else. You cannot let people who don't wish to separate church and state over into countries which DO have a separation of church and state. This is the fundamental difference between our Christians over here and the muslims in these countries. The Christians, as much as they have faith in their religion and such, will not step their boundaries and will leave the church out of the affairs of the state and governing. 

How about we just fucking wait until they catch up to us when it comes to basic human rights? Before you say ""But what about countries such as North Korea which lacks basic human rights"", well, North Korea is much different due to the fact that the people don't ask for all of the bullshit that the Kim family puts upon them. The muslims in many of these countries are a-okay with sharia law. 

&gt;As well: ""you will have nowhere to run and hide"". Holy shit are you that scared of Muslims? The vast majority of Muslims immigrating to America are doing so for their own opportunity and freedom, not to ""destroy your way of life"".

You think I'm scared of a single muslim? Fuck no. But I am scared of the long term effects of them coming in and staying in here, growing and growing until they just eventually take over everything.

I'm also scared of the possibilities of people being hurt just because you wanted to give people the benefit of the doubt that they'd do no harm. It's not worth the risk of bringing people in if you feel like with good reason that a certain portion of the group is out to harm us.

And fuck you for thinking it's not okay to be scared. It's absolutely okay. I can see how bad it is when you let these people grow out of control and I do not want that happening over here. I want my country to stay the way it is and I refuse to believe in any bullshit that shit won't change if you let them continuing to come in. I don't wanna fucking see areas of [where I live in turned into no-go zones like in the UK.](http://www.lbc.co.uk/ferrari-trump-is-right-there-are-no-go-areas-in-london-121220) I don't want [muslims marching about wanting to instate sharia law into our constitution](http://www.express.co.uk/news/uk/134080/Now-Muslims-demand-full-Sharia-law).

I just hope to god that my fears are wrong but the more I try to think that way, the more it feels like I'm just lying to myself, so I can only hope and fucking pray to god that I am wrong about them. I don't wish for it to be like this, but from what I've seen, my way is likely the best way to go.",1449791971,cxuqe5s

9124,ThatOneThingOnce,"Downplay may be a more appropriate term, but I would prefer to say that I am attempting to put it in to context. Islamic terrorism is a small fraction of terrorism in the US according to the FBI (http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/01/14/are-all-terrorists-muslims-it-s-not-even-close.html), yet we as a society focus far more on it than any other type. That is not to say it doesn't deserve attention, or that 9/11 types of attacks shouldn't be foiled as much as possible, but that maybe fearing it constantly and passing laws to restrict people's rights/freedoms without rhyme or reason is not the way to handle the situation.

As to your questions, I'll attempt to answer them, though obviously I'm not a policy maker or even someone who knows all the details about this latest terrorist attack.
The first, I would say that no it is probably not acceptable that a potential terrorist was allowed access into this country on the fiance visa system. But, a) I haven't read this thought yet, so I can't claim she was radicalized beforehand b) if she was, but hadn't committed a crime yet or spoken out in hate of America or other groups of people, it would be difficult to tell if she was truly radicalized (i.e. where is the line here for that definition?) and c) this kind of misses the point that the husband was also radicalized and living in the US already as a citizen.
For your second question, I would say that this is a difficult thing to fix, and that I am not a security expert in these affairs. My layman's opinion would be to increase the scrutiny of the checks on the system, but if a rigorous background check didn't catch anything on her (though I don't know the level of scrutiny this had, just assuming), I don't know what else would. This would include, by the way, having some kind of religious test for visa application, as she could simply deny that she is Islamic, forge evidence to such effect, etc. and still beat the system. Basically, catching would be terrorists at points of entry are policies we should pursue, but they are not a catch all for stopping them, and that other law enforcement efforts should also be used/focused on.
Finally, to your last question, that is actually a difficult question to answer, again not being even remotely involved in such things. The idea of suspending such a program would not be taken off the table if I truly thought it was being exploited, but there are plenty of reasons not to suspend it. First, implementing greater scrutiny around the applicants without their knowledge may actually lead to increased arrests of potential terrorists (and suspending it would tip them off). Secondly, the program itself is rather small (I read somewhere only about 500 people, but maybe that is wrong), so possibly no time is really needed to implement new policies. Thirdly, I'm not convinced yet the visa program is broken, or that it is the ultimate way to stop terrorists. But if it were shown that it was truly being exploited (and not a one off instance), then yes, suspending it might make sense depending on how many and to what level people are affected by such a temporary suspension, if a viable path to an alternative was in place and a timeline was established of when a new policy was to be implemented.
This, however, is not the same thing as Trump is suggesting. It would not target one group of people, but rather the whole program. It would take into account who this affected and to what extent. And it would have a clear timeline to be fixed. Suggesting an indefinite period until the problem is solved is not the solution I would endorse, but appears to be Trump's terms.

9181,Keif_Stones_0-o,"Hi. In regards to imigration from the middle east right now. i feel if we don't let people in from those countries, they will have nowhere to go. if they are willing to leave their home and travel to the USA for a better life, that is one hell of a journey and I welcome people with that much courage because our country is made of those people and it is why I love the US beyond its many problems. 

I think Trump has viewpoints that were the ones of the leaders in WW1 and WW2, he wants to outcast Muslims albeit until we can figure out whats happening, but this is awfully similar to what happened to the Japanese during WW2. 

I disagree with your viewpoints and I strongly do not support Trump, but we are all Americans and if we can't discuss these matters with eachother our country will become separated and lost in a sea of untrust. I do not think having Trump as president will bring the world any closer to where it belongs - United. These ancient viewpoints he has, that many politicians have, are tearing the world apart. we must accept everyone even if it brings danger because Daesh and the evils in the world today want an inballence, they want us to fight and argue and waste time achieving nothing.

I am willing to sacrifice my safety today for the better of tomorrow, if we do not make a stand for world unity, what will the history books say about this generation, Our grandfathers were willing to fight in WW2 to save the earth from the growing evils. 

I believe we live in an equally perilous time, and I think the point of what i'm saying is I don't think people realize this and are quite selfish because we life in such a safe country. We need to join the rest of the world and wake up from our comfortably numb false reality that the media puts on all this stuff.

It's tough because what we are currently doing isn't working.  The problem in regards to the game United thing is that the liberals want us to be divided.  That's how they gain power.

The people I hang out with in my engineering classes tend to be the same people every year but they really dont care, we sometimes joke about it when politics comes up. There is also a area that is a different engineering department, its like a hang out area but there are always new people there and sometimes they see my hat, they look at it with wide eyes, a few people told me that they need to get one of those hats but I never really encountered anyone talking negatively about it behind my back besides the few Hispanic incidents i mentioned. In that hang out area the people there are more liberal and we talk about politics at least 1 time a day but they dont really care. But its fun to joke about it. Never really met any hardcore liberals but they like Bernie so we kinda go back and forth. Soft banter but thats about it.

&gt; On Thursday, one of the federal government sources told The Times that Farook asked his friend and neighbor, Enrique Marquez, to buy two military-style rifles used in the attacks because he feared he &amp;quot;Wouldn&amp;#039;t pass a background check&amp;quot; if he attempted to acquire the weapons on his own.

&gt; The former Wal-Mart security guard has waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with the inquiry, and it was Marquez who told FBI agents about Farook&amp;#039;s earlier plans, according to one of the government sources, who also requested anonymity.

&gt; While Marquez has spoken to agents about his ties to Farook, federal officials are still working to verify the information he has provided, the source said.

(Look at how Trump is now forcing liberalism to defend its wide-open borders, _in the context of the media being forced to argue that Americanism requires us to allow all jihadis in who want to come in_. What a terrible position to be making that argument in! Wait until he does that to Hillary, when the media will be forced to argue that it's _vital_ that we elect a liar. I fully expect New York Times editorials to come out singing the praises of someone _brave_ enough to continuously lie to them about pretty much everything and how that makes Hillary the only viable choice, because Trump just is _too darned focused_ on speaking his mind, which is, by some convoluted train of NYT logic, somehow a terribly dangerous thing to democracy.)",1449844569,cxvc3th

If he gets into three-person debates and starts calling Hillary and Rubio on their bullshit, it could be a huge boost for him. Ross Perot was leading in the polls in '92 before he pulled a nutty. He might have won the whole thing if he had just stayed in. If he could do it, so can Trump.",1449896587,cxw72p8

The [Iowa Electronic Prediction markets](http://tippie.uiowa.edu/iem/) have been working for a while now. Also, if the site it abroad it's usually easier as long as the site doesn't break U.S. federal laws. (Unless you live in Washington State or Nevada.) There was a popular site called Intrade that was popular during the 2012 election cycle, but the mistake they made and got prosecuted on was they had a betting market on what the DJIA would be. That's illegal because that betting market derives its value from regulated financial markets, making it a market derivative and thus subject to regulation by the CFTC.) The CFTC was unapologetic in prosecuting them to the fullest extent of the law over that one. More recent successful betting markets have learned from that and taken a pro-active self-regulating approach. The most popular I know of is predictit.com, which got a letter of No-Action from the CFTC as long as it kept itself within certain limits it had proposed for itself: No bet's exceeding $850, and only things related to politics (which, in particular, means nothing touching financial instruments regulated by the CFTC). Predictit works out of New Zealand, so most states don't have laws against using them, except for Washington and Nevada which have laws against using the site even in that case. There's a few similar sites but they're much smaller.

Anyway the Sword is critical theory. Which is taught in most universities, and focus's on dividing people into different groups. It's goal is to anger minorities telling them they are victims. And to promote feminism to turn Women against Men. It's goal is to erode confidence in the USA as a fair, and just society. In other words to make you hate it so you support whatever change they tell you is needed.

The Shield is political correctness. It takes these victim groups, and makes it so that you are not allowed to criticize them unless you are one of them. If you do then you are given a label like Racist, and ignored. This way they are immune to counter attack. Over the years it seems like these people were pushed into journalism, and they make heavy use of it making sure the groups they want protected stay protected. Which is also why they don't report facts that run counter to the narratives taught by critical theory.

Anyway not really sure what advice to give on breaking through the shield of political correctness. Since most people are not going to listen to long winded theory on what it is, and what it's really for.

Trump needs to get to over 50% fast.

States holding their primaries from March 1 to March 14 will have their delegates proportionally assigned. On the plus side, this change was changed to favor Jeb Bush - but of course it will backfire and favor Trump.

But that's not the problem. The problem is Rule 40 - now he will have to win 8 states outright. Right now Georgia, North Carolina, and a few other states are looking good. But winning Iowa would increase momentum tremendously!

After the ""proportionally assigned"" states, then you get the winner take all states like Illinois, Florida, and Ohio. This is no problem if you get only 30% of the votes as long as you win.

Of course, this is all backfiring heavily on the Establishment. But I think Trump needs to get 50%+ support in many states fast, and really secure Iowa and New Hampshire.",1450048921,cxy0lfb
